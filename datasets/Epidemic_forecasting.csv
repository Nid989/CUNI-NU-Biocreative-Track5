In India, the number of cases is constantly increasing since the first case reported on January 30, 2020, resulting in a total of 81,997 cases including 2649 deaths as of May 14, 2020. To assist the government and healthcare sector in preventing the transmission of disease, it is necessary to predict the future confirmed cases. To predict the dynamics of COVID-19 cases, in this paper, we project the forecast of COVID-19 for five most affected states of India such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh using the real-time data. Using Holt-Winters method, a forecast of the number of confirmed cases in these states has been generated. Further, the performance of the method has been determined using RMSE, MSE, MAPE, MAE and compared with other standard algorithms. The analysis shows that the proposed Holt-Winters model generates RMSE value of 76.0, 338.4, 141.5, 425.9, 1991.5 for Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and Tamil Nadu, which results in more accurate predictions over Holt's Linear, Auto-regression (AR), Moving Average (MA) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. These estimations may further assist the government in employing strong policies and strategies for enhancing healthcare support all over India.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Observing the failures of several COVID-19 forecasting models and the alarming spread of the virus, we seek to use some stable response for forecasting COVID-19, viz., ratios of COVID-19 cases to mortalities, rather than COVID-19 cases or fatalities. A trend of low COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios calls for urgent attention: the need for vaccines, for instance. Studies have shown that there are influences of weather parameters on COVID-19; and COVID-19 may have come to stay and could manifest a seasonal outbreak profile similar to other infectious respiratory diseases. In this paper, the influences of some weather, geographical, economic and demographic covariates were evaluated on COVID-19 response based on a series of Granger-causality tests. The effect of four weather parameters, viz., temperature, rainfall, solar irradiation and relative humidity, on daily COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios of 36 countries from 5 continents of the world were determined through regression analysis. Regression studies show that these four weather factors impact ratios of COVID-19 cases-to-mortality differently. The most impactful factor is temperature which is positively correlated with COVID-19 cases-to-mortality responses in 24 out of 36 countries. Temperature minimally affects COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios in the tropical countries. The most influential weather factor - temperature - was incorporated in training random forest and deep learning models for forecasting the cases-to-mortality rate of COVID-19 in clusters of countries in the world with similar weather conditions. Evaluation of trained forecasting models incorporating temperature features show better performance compared to a similar set of models trained without temperature features. This implies that COVID-19 forecasting models will predict more accurately if temperature features are factored in, especially for temperate countries. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

World Health Organization (WHO) declared Covid-19 as a pandemic on 12th March 2020. Researchers and policy makers are designing strategies to control the pandemic in order to minimize its impact on human health and economy round the clock. The SARS-CoV-2 virus transmits mostly through respiratory droplets and through contaminated surfacesin human body.Securing an appropriate level of safety during the pandemic situation is a highly problematic issue which resulted from the transportation sector which has been hit hard by COVID-19. This paper focuses on developing an intelligent computing model for forecasting the outbreak of COVID-19. The Facebook Prophet model predicts 90 days future values including the peak date of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 for six worst hit countries of the world including India and six high incidence states of India. The model also identifies five significant changepoints in the growth curve of confirmed cases of India which indicate the impact of the interventions imposed by Government of India on the growth rate of the infection. The goodness-of-fit of the model measures 85% MAPE for all six countries and all six states of India. The above computational analysis may be able to throw some light on planning and management of healthcare system and infrastructure.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Moreover, during pandemic outbreaks, the hospitals are overwhelmed with patients requiring more intensive care units and intubation equipment. Therein, to cope with these urgent healthcare demands, the state authorities seek ways to develop policies based on the estimated future casualties. These policies are mainly non-pharmacological policies including the restrictions, curfews, closures, and lockdowns. In this paper, we construct three model structures of the S(p)I(n)I(t)I(b)D-N (suspicious S(p), infected I(n), intensive care I(t), intubated I(b), and dead D together with the non-pharmacological policies N) holding two key targets. The first one is to predict the future COVID-19 casualties including the intensive care and intubated ones, which directly determine the need for urgent healthcare facilities, and the second one is to analyse the linear and non-linear dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic under the non-pharmacological policies. In this respect, we have modified the non-pharmacological policies and incorporated them within the models whose parameters are learned from the available data. The trained models with the data released by the Turkish Health Ministry confirmed that the linear S(p)I(n)I(t)I(b)D-N model yields more accurate results under the imposed non-pharmacological policies. It is important to note that the non-pharmacological policies have a damping effect on the pandemic casualties and this can dominate the non-linear dynamics. Herein, a model without pharmacological or non-pharmacological policies might have more dominant non-linear dynamics. In addition, the paper considers two machine learning approaches to optimize the unknown parameters of the constructed models. The results show that the recursive neural network has superior performance for learning nonlinear dynamics. However, the batch least squares outperforms in the presence of linear dynamics and stochastic data. The estimated future pandemic casualties with the linear S(p)I(n)I(t)I(b)D-N model confirm that the suspicious, infected, and dead casualties converge to zero from 200000, 1400, 200 casualties, respectively. The convergences occur in 120 days under the current conditions.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34411132,An application of the ensemble Kalman filter in epidemiological modelling.,,"Since the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in China, and due to the open accessibility of COVID-19 data, several researchers and modellers revisited the classical epidemiological models to evaluate their practical applicability. While mathematical compartmental models can predict various contagious viruses' dynamics, their efficiency depends on the model parameters. Recently, several parameter estimation methods have been proposed for different models. In this study, we evaluated the Ensemble Kalman filter's performance (EnKF) in the estimation of time-varying model parameters with synthetic data and the real COVID-19 data of Hubei province, China. Contrary to the previous works, in the current study, the effect of damping factors on an augmented EnKF is studied. An augmented EnKF algorithm is provided, and we present how the filter performs in estimating models using uncertain observational (reported) data. Results obtained confirm that the augumented-EnKF approach can provide reliable model parameter estimates. Additionally, there was a good fit of profiles between model simulation and the reported COVID-19 data confirming the possibility of using the augmented-EnKF approach for reliable model parameter estimation.",Epidemic Forecasting
34407487,Implementation of Stacking Based ARIMA Model for Prediction of Covid-19 Cases in India.,arima;covid-19;forecasting;hybrid model;nar,"BACKGROUND: Time-series forecasting has a critical role during pandemics as it provides essential information that can lead to abstaining from the spread of the disease. The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, is spreading rapidly all over the world. The countries with dense populations, in particular, such as India, await imminent risk in tackling the epidemic. Different forecasting models are being used to predict future cases of COVID-19. The predicament for most of them is that they are not able to capture both the linear and nonlinear features of the data solely. METHODS: We propose an ensemble model integrating an autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and a nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NAR). ARIMA models are used to extract the linear correlations and the NAR neural network for modeling the residuals of ARIMA containing nonlinear components of the data. Comparison: Single ARIMA model, ARIMA-NAR model and few other existing models which have been applied on the COVID-19 data in different countries are compared based on performance evaluation parameters. RESULT: The hybrid combination displayed significant reduction in RMSE(16.23%), MAE(37.89%) and MAPE (39.53%) values when compared with single ARIMA model for daily observed cases. Similar results with reduced error percentages were found for daily reported deaths and cases of recovery as well. RMSE value of our hybrid model was lesser in comparison to other models used for forecasting COVID-19 in different countries. CONCLUSION: Results suggested the effectiveness of the new hybrid model over a single ARIMA model in capturing the linear as well as nonlinear patterns of the COVID-19 data.",Epidemic Forecasting

The COVID-19 epidemic started to gain traction in France in March 2020. Sub-national hospital admissions and deaths were then recorded daily and served as the main policy indicators. Concurrently, mobile phone positioning data have been curated to determine the frequency of users being colocalized within a given distance. Contrarily to individual tracking data, these can provide a proxy of human contact networks between subnational administrative units. MethodsMotivated by numerous studies correlating human mobility data and disease incidence, we developed predictive time series models of hospital incidence between July 2020 and April 2021. We added human contact network analytics such as clustering coefficients, contact network strength, null links or curvature as regressors. FindingsWe found that predictions can be improved substantially (more than 50%) both at the national and sub-national for up to two weeks. Our sub-national analysis also revealed the importance of spatial structure, as incidence in colocalized administrative units improved predictions. This original application of network analytics from co-localisation data to epidemic spread opens new perspectives for epidemics forecasting and public health.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

For the dynamics of COVID-19, we propose a stochastic epidemic model, with time-delays, Susceptible-Infected-Asymptomatic-Quarantined-Recovered (SIAQR). One global positive solution exists with probability one in the model. As a threshold condition of persistence and existence of an ergodic stationary distribution, we deduce a generalized stochastic threshold R 0 s < R 0 . To estimate the percentages of people who must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, least-squares approaches were used to estimate R 0 from real observations in the UAE. Our results suggest that when R 0 > 1 , a proportion max ( 1 - 1 / R 0 ) of the population needs to be immunized/vaccinated during the pandemic wave. Numerical simulations show that the proposed stochastic delay differential model is consistent with the physical sensitivity and fluctuation of the real observations.",Epidemic Forecasting

A persistent increase in the number of positive cases has boost the stress among governments across the globe. There is a need of approach which gives more accurate predictions of outbreak. This paper presents a novel approach called diffusion prediction model for prediction of number of coronavirus cases in four countries: India, France, China and Nepal. Diffusion prediction model works on the diffusion process of the human contact. Model considers two forms of spread: when the spread takes time after infecting one person and when the spread is immediate after infecting one person. It makes the proposed model different over other state-of-the art models. It is giving more accurate results than other state-of-the art models. The proposed diffusion prediction model forecasts the number of new cases expected to occur in next 4 weeks. The model has predicted the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths and active cases. The model can facilitate government to be well prepared for any abrupt rise in this pandemic. The performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy and error rate and compared with the prediction results of support vector machine, logistic regression model and convolution neural network. The results prove the efficiency of the proposed model.",Epidemic Forecasting
34400735,A particle swarm optimization approach for predicting the number of COVID-19 deaths.,,"The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has raised huge concerns about the prospect of a major health disaster that would result in a huge number of deaths. This anxiety was largely fueled by the fact that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the disease, was so far unknown, and therefore an accurate prediction of the number of deaths was particularly difficult. However, this prediction is of the utmost importance for public health authorities to make the most reliable decisions and establish the necessary precautions to protect people's lives. In this paper, we present an approach for predicting the number of deaths from COVID-19. This approach requires modeling the number of infected cases using a generalized logistic function and using this function for inferring the number of deaths. An estimate of the parameters of the proposed model is obtained using a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) that requires iteratively solving a quadratic programming problem. In addition to the total number of deaths and number of infected cases, the model enables the estimation of the infection fatality rate (IFR). Furthermore, using some mild assumptions, we derive estimates of the number of active cases. The proposed approach was empirically assessed on official data provided by the State of Qatar. The results of our computational study show a good accuracy of the predicted number of deaths.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Nigeria was locked down in March, 2020 as the country battled to contain the spread of the disease. By August 2020, phase-by-phase easing of the lockdown was commenced and university students will soon return for academic activities. This study undertakes some epidemiological analysis of the Nigerian COVID-19 data to help the government and university administrators make informed decisions on the safety of personnel and students.The COVID-19 data on confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered were obtained from the website of the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) from April 2, 2020 to August 24, 2020. The infection rate, prevalence, ratio, cause-specific death rate, and case recovery rate were used to evaluate the epidemiological characteristics of the pandemic in Nigeria. Exponential smoothing was adopted in modeling the time series data and forecasting the pandemic in Nigeria up to January 31, 2021.The results indicated that the pandemic had infection rate of at most 3 infections per 1 million per day from April to August 2020. The death rate was 5 persons per 1 million during the period of study while recovery rate was 747 persons per 1000 infections. Analysis of forecast data showed steady but gradual decrease in the daily infection rate and death rate and substantial increase in the recovery rate, 975 recoveries per 1000 infections.In general, the epidemiological attributes of the pandemic from the original data and the forecast data indicated optimism in the decrease in the rate of infection and death in the future. Moreover, the infection rate, prevalence and death rate in January 2021 coincided with the predictions based on the analysis. Therefore, the Nigerian government is encouraged to allow universities in the country to reopen while university administrators set up the necessary protocols for strict adherence to safety measures.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34395949,A simple mathematical tool to forecast COVID-19 cumulative case numbers.,covid-19;epidemic forecasting;mathematical model;pandemic;sars-cov-2,"Objective: Mathematical models are known to help determine potential intervention strategies by providing an approximate idea of the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. To develop proper responses, not only are more accurate disease spread models needed, but also those that are easy to use. Materials and methods: As of July 1, 2020, we selected the 20 countries with the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases in the world. Using the Verhulst-Pearl logistic function formula, we calculated estimates for the total number of cases for each country. We compared these estimates to the actual figures given by the WHO on the same dates. Finally, the formula was tested for longer-term reliability at t = 18 and t = 40 weeks. Results: The Verhulst-Pearl logistic function formula estimated the actual numbers precisely, with only a 0.5% discrepancy on average for the first month. For all countries in the study and the world at large, the estimates for the 40th week were usually overestimated, although the estimates for some countries were still relatively close to the actual numbers in the forecasting long term. The estimated number for the world in general was about 8 times that actually observed for the long term. Conclusions: The Verhulst-Pearl equation has the advantage of being very straightforward and applicable in clinical use for predicting the demand on hospitals in the short term of 4-6 weeks, which is usually enough time to reschedule elective procedures and free beds for new waves of the pandemic patients.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The aim of our study was to use the official epidemiological data to forecast the epidemic curves (daily new cases) of the COVID-19 using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), then to compare and validate the predicted models with the observed data. Methods: We used publicly available datasets from the World Health Organization and Johns Hopkins University to create a training dataset, then we employed RNNs with gated recurring units (Long Short-Term Memory - LSTM units) to create two prediction models. Our proposed approach considers an ensemble-based system, which is realized by interconnecting several neural networks. To achieve the appropriate diversity, we froze some network layers that control the way how the model parameters are updated. In addition, we could provide country-specific predictions by transfer learning, and with extra feature injections from governmental constraints, better predictions in the longer term are achieved. We have calculated the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to thoroughly compare our model predictions with the observed data. Results: We reported the predicted curves for France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. The result of our study underscores that the COVID-19 pandemic is a propagated source epidemic, therefore repeated peaks on the epidemic curve are to be anticipated. Besides, the errors between the predicted and validated data and trends seem to be low. Conclusion: Our proposed model has shown satisfactory accuracy in predicting the new cases of COVID-19 in certain contexts. The influence of this pandemic is significant worldwide and has already impacted most life domains. Decision-makers must be aware, that even if strict public health measures are executed and sustained, future peaks of infections are possible. The AI-based models are useful tools for forecasting epidemics as these models can be recalculated according to the newly observed data to get a more precise forecasting.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We assume the disease-dynamics is described by a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-susceptible (SEIRS) epidemic model, where the infected class is divided into the asymptomatic infected, and symptomatic infectious classes. Stochasticity appears in the model due to fluctuations in the disease's transmission and recovery rates. The disease eradication threshold is derived from the reproduction number. The estimated parameters are used to model the disease outbreak's possible trajectories. Our analysis reveals that current interventions are having positive effects on the transmission and recovery rates.

Simulation results illustrate that there is a cut-down in effective contact rate by a considerable factor ranging from 2 to 4 for the selected regions. Further, the estimates for the vaccines to be developed, maximum range and span of the disease can be also estimated.

For that purpose, there are two types of dataset used in this study: One is COVID-19 Death cases, a Time Series Data and the other is COVID-19 Confirmed Case and Death Cases where Death case is dependent variable and the Confirmed case is an independent variable. Hyperparameter optimization or tuning is used in these regression models, which is the process of identifying a set of optimal hyperparameters for any learning process with minimal error. Here, sigma (sigma) is a hyperparameter whose value is used to constrain the learning process of the above models with minimum Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Researchers in different fields are continually working to develop vaccines and prevention strategies. However, an accurate forecast of the outbreak can help control the pandemic until a vaccine is available. Several machine learning and deep learning-based approaches are available to forecast the confirmed cases, but they lack the optimized temporal component and nonlinearity. To enhance the current forecasting frameworks' capability, we proposed optimized long short-term memory networks (LSTM) to forecast COVID-19 cases and reduce mean absolute error. For the optimization of LSTM, we applied bat algorithm. Furthermore, to tackle the premature convergence and local minima problem of BA, we proposed an enhanced variant of BA. The proposed version utilized Gaussian adaptive inertia weight to control the individual velocity in the entire swarm. In addition, we substitute random walk with the Gaussian walk to observe the local search mechanism. The proposed LSTM examines the personal best solution with the swarm's local best and preserves the optimal solution by combining the Gaussian walk. To evaluate the optimized LSTM, we compared it with the non-optimal version of LSTM, recurrent neural network, gated recurrent units, and other recent state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results prove the superiority of the optimized LSTM over other recent algorithms by obtaining 99.52 % accuracy.",Epidemic Forecasting

Excess mortality has been suggested as the most appropriate indicator to measure the overall burden of the pandemic in terms of mortality. As such, excess mortality has received considerable interest since the outbreak of COVID-19 began. Previous approaches to estimate excess mortality are somewhat limited, as they do not include sufficiently long-term trends, correlations among different demographic and geographic groups, or autocorrelations in the mortality time series. This might lead to biased estimates of excess mortality, as random mortality fluctuations may be misinterpreted as excess mortality. We propose a novel approach that overcomes the named limitations and draws a more realistic picture of excess mortality. Our approach is based on an established forecasting model that is used in demography, namely, the Lee-Carter model. We illustrate our approach by using the weekly age- and sex-specific mortality data for 19 countries and the current COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. Our findings show evidence of considerable excess mortality during 2020 in Europe, which affects different countries, age, and sex groups heterogeneously. Our proposed model can be applied to future pandemics as well as to monitor excess mortality from specific causes of death.",Epidemic Forecasting

However, not all COVID-19 deaths are recognized and reported because of limitations in testing, exacerbation of chronic health conditions that are listed as the cause of death, or delays in reporting. Estimating deaths may provide a more comprehensive understanding of total COVID-19-attributable deaths. Methods: We estimated COVID-19 unrecognized attributable deaths, from March 2020-April 2021, using all-cause deaths reported to NVSS by week and six age groups (0-17, 18-49, 50-64, 65-74, 75-84, and >/=85 years) for 50 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia using a linear time series regression model. Reported COVID-19 deaths were subtracted from all-cause deaths before applying the model. Weekly expected deaths, assuming no SARS-CoV-2 circulation and predicted all-cause deaths using SARS-CoV-2 weekly percent positive as a covariate were modelled by age group and including state as a random intercept. COVID-19-attributable unrecognized deaths were calculated for each state and age group by subtracting the expected all-cause deaths from the predicted deaths. Findings: We estimated that 766,611 deaths attributable to COVID-19 occurred in the United States from March 8, 2020-May 29, 2021. Of these, 184,477 (24%) deaths were not documented on death certificates. Eighty-two percent of unrecognized deaths were among persons aged >/=65 years; the proportion of unrecognized deaths were 0*24-0*31 times lower among those 0-17 years relative to all other age groups. More COVID-19-attributable deaths were not captured during the early months of the pandemic (March-May 2020) and during increases in SARS-CoV-2 activity (July 2020, November 2020-February 2021).

We estimate infection-level responsive lockdown/self-quarantine entry and exit rates (representing government and behavioural reaction), along with the true number of cases as of 31 May 2020. Ultimately, we provide error-corrected estimates for commonly used metrics such as infection fatality ratio and overall case ascertainment for all 55 states and territories considered, along with the USA in aggregate, in order to correlate outbreak severity with first wave intervention attributes and suggest potential management strategies for future outbreaks. We observe a theoretically predicted inverse proportionality relation between outbreak size and lockdown rate, with scale dependent on the underlying reproduction number and simulations suggesting a critical population quarantine 'half-life' of 30 days independent of other model parameters.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34385538,A simple mathematical model for the evaluation of the long first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.,,"We propose herein a mathematical model to predict the COVID-19 evolution and evaluate the impact of governmental decisions on this evolution, attempting to explain the long duration of the pandemic in the 26 Brazilian states and their capitals well as in the Federative Unit. The prediction was performed based on the growth rate of new cases in a stable period, and the graphics plotted with the significant governmental decisions to evaluate the impact on the epidemic curve in each Brazilian state and city. Analysis of the predicted new cases was correlated with the total number of hospitalizations and deaths related to COVID-19. Because Brazil is a vast country, with high heterogeneity and complexity of the regional/local characteristics and governmental authorities among Brazilian states and cities, we individually predicted the epidemic curve based on a specific stable period with reduced or minimal interference on the growth rate of new cases. We found good accuracy, mainly in a short period (weeks). The most critical governmental decisions had a significant temporal impact on pandemic curve growth. A good relationship was found between the predicted number of new cases and the total number of inpatients and deaths related to COVID-19. In summary, we demonstrated that interventional and preventive measures directly and significantly impact the COVID-19 pandemic using a simple mathematical model. This model can easily be applied, helping, and directing health and governmental authorities to make further decisions to combat the pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34385518,Determination of critical decision points for COVID-19 measures in Japan.,,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout the world. The prediction of the number of cases has become essential to governments' ability to define policies and take countermeasures in advance. The numbers of cases have been estimated using compartment models of infectious diseases such as the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model and its derived models. However, the required use of hypothetical future values for parameters, such as the effective reproduction number or infection rate, increases the uncertainty of the prediction results. Here, we describe our model for forecasting future COVID-19 cases based on observed data by considering the time delay (tdelay). We used machine learning to estimate the future infection rate based on real-time mobility, temperature, and relative humidity. We then used this calculation with the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to forecast future cases with less uncertainty. The results suggest that changes in mobility affect observed infection rates with 5-10 days of time delay. This window should be accounted for in the decision-making phase especially during periods with predicted infection surges. Our prediction model helps governments and medical institutions to take targeted early countermeasures at critical decision points regarding mobility to avoid significant levels of infection rise.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34381100,A modified SEIR model to predict the behavior of the early stage in coronavirus and coronavirus-like outbreaks.,,"COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease that emerged in China at the end of 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic is the first known pandemic caused by a coronavirus, namely, the new and emerging SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. In the present work, we present simulations of the initial outbreak of this new coronavirus using a modified transmission rate SEIR model that takes into account the impact of government actions and the perception of risk by individuals in reaction to the proportion of fatal cases. The parameters related to these effects were fitted to the number of infected cases in the 33 provinces of China. The data for Hubei Province, the probable site of origin of the current pandemic, were considered as a particular case for the simulation and showed that the theoretical model reproduces the behavior of the data, thus indicating the importance of combining government actions and individual risk perceptions when the proportion of fatal cases is greater than [Formula: see text]. The results show that the adjusted model reproduces the behavior of the data quite well for some provinces, suggesting that the spread of the disease differs when different actions are evaluated. The proposed model could help to predict outbreaks of viruses with a biological and molecular structure similar to that of SARS-CoV-2.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Taking advantage of the real-time availability of COVID-19 related data, we perform a compartmental model fitting analysis of the portuguese case, using an online open-access platform with the integrated capability of solving systems of differential equations. This analysis enabled the data-driven validation of the used model and was the basis for robust projections of different future scenarios, namely, increasing the detected infected population, reopening schools at different moments, allowing Easter celebrations to take place and population vaccination. The method presented in this work can easily be used to perform the non-trivial task of simultaneously fitting differential equation solutions to different epidemiological data sets, regardless of the model or country that might be considered in the analysis.",Epidemic Forecasting

STUDY DESIGN: The study design was a retrospective observational study conducted using the secondary data provided by the Our World in Data project on a public domain. SETTING: This study was conducted based on worldwide deaths by COVID-19 recorded for the Our World in Data project from 29 February 2020 to 17 February 2021. METHODS: Estimating the trend in COVID-19 deaths is not a trivial task due to the problems associated with the COVID-19 data, such as the spatial and temporal heterogeneity, observed seasonality and the delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis, indicating a relevant measurement error problem and changing the series' dependency structure. To bypass the aforementioned problems, we propose a method to estimate the components of trend, seasonality and cycle in COVID-19 data, controlling for the presence of measurement error and considering the spatial heterogeneity. We used the proposed model to estimate the trend component of deaths by COVID-19 on a global scale. RESULTS: The model was able to capture the patterns in the occurrence of deaths related to COVID-19, overcoming the problems observed in COVID-19 data. We found compelling evidence that spatiotemporal models are more accurate than univariate models to estimate the patterns of the occurrence of deaths. Based on the measures of dispersion of the models' prediction in relation to observed deaths, it is possible to note that the models with spatial component are significantly superior to the univariate model. CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that the spatial dynamics have an important role in the COVID-19 epidemic process since the results provided evidence that spatiotemporal models are more accurate to estimate the general patterns of the occurrence of deaths related to COVID-19.",Epidemic Forecasting
34380614,A general model for the demographic signatures of the transition from pandemic emergence to endemicity.,,"Anticipating the medium- and long-term trajectory of pathogen emergence has acquired new urgency given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For many human pathogens, the burden of disease depends on age and previous exposure. Understanding the intersection between human population demography and transmission dynamics is therefore critical. Here, we develop a realistic age-structured mathematical model that integrates demography, social mixing, and immunity to establish a plausible range for future age incidence and mortality. With respect to COVID-19, we identify a plausible transition in the age structure of risks once the disease reaches seasonal endemism across a range of immunity durations and relative severity of primary versus subsequent reinfections. We train the model using diverse real-world demographies and age-structured mixing to bound expectations for changing age incidence and disease burden. The mathematical framework is flexible and can help tailor mitigation strategies in countries worldwide with varying demographies and social mixing patterns.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

As of January 21, 2021, the virus had infected approximately 100 million people, causing over 2 million deaths. This article analyzed several time series forecasting methods to predict the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic's second wave in Italy (the period after October 13, 2020). The autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) model, innovations state space models for exponential smoothing (ETS), the neural network autoregression (NNAR) model, the trigonometric exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors, and trend and seasonal components (TBATS), and all of their feasible hybrid combinations were employed to forecast the number of patients hospitalized with mild symptoms and the number of patients hospitalized in the intensive care units (ICU). The data for the period February 21, 2020-October 13, 2020 were extracted from the website of the Italian Ministry of Health ( www.salute.gov.it ). The results showed that (i) hybrid models were better at capturing the linear, nonlinear, and seasonal pandemic patterns, significantly outperforming the respective single models for both time series, and (ii) the numbers of COVID-19-related hospitalizations of patients with mild symptoms and in the ICU were projected to increase rapidly from October 2020 to mid-November 2020. According to the estimations, the necessary ordinary and intensive care beds were expected to double in 10 days and to triple in approximately 20 days.

During the pandemic, health care systems require accurate forecasts for key resources to guide preparation for patient surges. Forecasting the COVID-19 hospital census is among the most important planning decisions to ensure adequate staffing, number of beds, intensive care units, and vital equipment. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to explore the potential utility of local COVID-19 infection incidence data in developing a forecasting model for the COVID-19 hospital census. METHODS: The study data comprised aggregated daily COVID-19 hospital census data across 11 Atrium Health hospitals plus a virtual hospital in the greater Charlotte metropolitan area of North Carolina, as well as the total daily infection incidence across the same region during the May 15 to December 5, 2020, period. Cross-correlations between hospital census and local infection incidence lagging up to 21 days were computed. A multivariate time-series framework, called the vector error correction model (VECM), was used to simultaneously incorporate both time series and account for their possible long-run relationship. Hypothesis tests and model diagnostics were performed to test for the long-run relationship and examine model goodness of fit. The 7-days-ahead forecast performance was measured by mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), with time-series cross-validation. The forecast performance was also compared with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model in the same cross-validation time frame. Based on different scenarios of the pandemic, the fitted model was leveraged to produce 60-days-ahead forecasts. RESULTS: The cross-correlations were uniformly high, falling between 0.7 and 0.8. There was sufficient evidence that the two time series have a stable long-run relationship at the .01 significance level. The model had very good fit to the data. The out-of-sample MAPE had a median of 5.9% and a 95th percentile of 13.4%. In comparison, the MAPE of the ARIMA had a median of 6.6% and a 95th percentile of 14.3%. Scenario-based 60-days-ahead forecasts exhibited concave trajectories with peaks lagging 2 to 3 weeks later than the peak infection incidence. In the worst-case scenario, the COVID-19 hospital census can reach a peak over 3 times greater than the peak observed during the second wave. CONCLUSIONS: When used in the VECM framework, the local COVID-19 infection incidence can be an effective leading indicator to predict the COVID-19 hospital census. The VECM model had a very good 7-days-ahead forecast performance and outperformed the traditional ARIMA model. Leveraging the relationship between the two time series, the model can produce realistic 60-days-ahead scenario-based projections, which can inform health care systems about the peak timing and volume of the hospital census for long-term planning purposes.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34344916,"Modelling, prediction and design of COVID-19 lockdowns by stringency and duration.",,"The implementation of lockdowns has been a key policy to curb the spread of COVID-19 and to keep under control the number of infections. However, quantitatively predicting in advance the effects of lockdowns based on their stringency and duration is a complex task, in turn making it difficult for governments to design effective strategies to stop the disease. Leveraging a novel mathematical ""hybrid"" approach, we propose a new epidemic model that is able to predict the future number of active cases and deaths when lockdowns with different stringency levels or durations are enforced. The key observation is that lockdown-induced modifications of social habits may not be captured by traditional mean-field compartmental models because these models assume uniformity of social interactions among the population, which fails during lockdown. Our model is able to capture the abrupt social habit changes caused by lockdowns. The results are validated on the data of Israel and Germany by predicting past lockdowns and providing predictions in alternative lockdown scenarios (different stringency and duration). The findings show that our model can effectively support the design of lockdown strategies by stringency and duration, and quantitatively forecast the course of the epidemic during lockdown.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Health planners are seeking ways to forecast the evolution of the pandemic. In this study, a mathematical model was proposed for Saudi Arabia, the country with the highest reported number of COVID-19 cases in the Arab world. METHODOLOGY: The proposed model was adapted from the model used for the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea. Using time-dependent parameters, the model incorporated the effects of both population-wide self-protective measures and government actions. Data before and after the government imposed control policies on 3 March 2020 were used to validate the model. Predictions for the disease's progression were provided together with the evaluation of the effectiveness of the mitigation measures implemented by the government and self-protective measures taken by the population. RESULTS: The model predicted that, if the government had continued to implement its strong control measures, then the scale of the pandemic would have decreased by 99% by the end of June 2020. Under the current relaxed policies, the model predicted that the scale of the pandemic will have decreased by 99% by 10 August 2020. The error between the model's predictions and actual data was less than 6.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Although the proposed model did not capture all of the effects of human behaviors and government actions, it was validated as a result of its time-dependent parameters.

We derive the three free parameters for both models in several cases and test them against the amount of data needed to bring accuracy in predictions. The SHR model is approximately +/-2% accurate about 20 days past the second inflexion point in the daily curve of cases, while the SIR model reaches a similar accuracy a fortnight before.

In the meantime, one should not overlook the significant role that mathematical descriptions play in epidemiology. In this paper, using some known definitions of fractional derivatives, which is a relatively new definition in differential calculus, and then by employing them in a mathematical framework, the effects of these tools in a better description of the epidemic of a SARS-CoV-2 infection is investigated. To solve these problems, efficient numerical methods have been used which can provide a very good approximation of the solution of the problem.

Firstly, we use the SIRD epidemic model (S-Susceptible, I-Infected, R-Recovered, D-Dead) which is a non-autonomous dynamic system with incubation time delay to study the evolution of the COVID-19 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province and China Mainland. According to the data in the early stage issued by the National Health Commission of China, we can accurately estimate the parameters of the model, and then accurately predict the evolution of the COVID-19 there. From the analysis of the issued data, we find that the cure rates in Wuhan City, Hubei Province and China Mainland are the approximately linear increasing functions of time t and their death rates are the piecewisely decreasing functions. These can be estimated by finite difference method. Secondly, we use the delayed SIRD epidemic model to study the evolution of the COVID-19 in the Hubei Province outside Wuhan City. We find that its cure rate is an approximately linear increasing function and its death rate is nearly a constant. Thirdly, we use the delayed SIR epidemic model (S-Susceptible, I-Infected, R-Removed) to predict those of Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Anhui Provinces. We find that their cure rates are the approximately linear increasing functions and their death rates are the small constants. The results indicate that it is possible to make accurate long-term predictions for numbers of current confirmed, accumulative dead cases of COVID-19 by modeling.

Considering this fact, the presented work is a proposal of two Internally Optimized Grey Prediction Models (IOGMs). These models are based on the modification of the conventional Grey Forecasting model (GM(1,1)). The IOGMs are formed by stacking infected case data with diverse overlap periods for forecasting pandemic spread at different locations in India. First, IOGM is tested using time series data. Its two models are then employed for forecasting the pandemic spread in three large Indian states namely, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and union territory Delhi. Several test runs are carried out to evaluate the performance of proposed grey models and conventional grey models GM(1,1) and NGM(1,1,k).

Since then, numerous measures have been taken to bring the infection under control. This was very successful in the spring of 2020, while the number of infections rose sharply the following autumn. To predict the occurrence of infections, epidemiological models are used. These are in principle a very valuable tool in pandemic management. However, they still partly need to be based on assumptions regarding the transmission routes and possible drivers of the infection dynamics. Despite numerous individual approaches, systematic epidemiological data are still lacking with which, for example, the effectiveness of individual measures could be quantified. Such information generated in studies is needed to enable reliable predictions regarding the further course of the pandemic. Thereby, the complexity of the models could develop hand in hand with the complexity of the available data. In this article, after delineating two basic classes of models, the contribution of epidemiological models to the assessment of various central aspects of the pandemic, such as the reproduction rate, the number of unreported cases, infection fatality rate, and the consideration of regionality, is shown.

Imperfections in planning vaccine acquisition and difficulties in implementing distribution among the population, however, have hampered the control of the virus so far. METHODS: We propose a new mathematical model to estimate the impact of vaccination delay against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the number of cases and deaths due to the disease in Brazil. We apply the model to Brazil as a whole and to the State of Sao Paulo, the most affected by COVID-19 in Brazil. We simulated the model for the populations of the State of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole, varying the scenarios related to vaccine efficacy and compliance from the populations. RESULTS: The model projects that, in the absence of vaccination, almost 170 thousand deaths and more than 350 thousand deaths will occur by the end of 2021 for Sao Paulo and Brazil, respectively. If in contrast, Sao Paulo and Brazil had enough vaccine supply and so started a vaccination campaign in January with the maximum vaccination rate, compliance and efficacy, they could have averted more than 112 thousand deaths and 127 thousand deaths, respectively. In addition, for each month of delay the number of deaths increases monotonically in a logarithmic fashion, for both the State of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole. CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows that the current delay in the vaccination schedules that is observed in many countries has serious consequences in terms of mortality by the disease and should serve as an alert to health authorities to speed the process up such that the highest number of people to be immunized is reached in the shortest period of time.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Treatment

Under the hypothesis of neutral evolution we compute analytically the average pairwise genetic distance between all infecting viruses over time. We also derive a mean-field version of this equation that can be added directly to compartmental models such as SIR or SEIR to estimate the genetic evolution. We compare our results with the inferred genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of the epidemic in China and found good agreement with the analytical solution of our model. Finally, using genetic distance as a proxy for different strains, we use numerical simulations to show that the lower the connectivity between communities, e.g., cities, the higher the probability of reinfection.",Epidemic Forecasting;Mechanism

Methods: Acceleration of the cases of confirmed infection and fatalities were calculated by using the concept of derivatives. Acceleration of fatality function was then determined from multivariate linear function and calculus chain rule for composite function with confirmed infections as an explanatory variable. Different ARIMA models were fitted for each acceleration of fatality function: the de-seasonalized Auto ARIMA Model, the adjusted lag model, and the auto ARIMA model with seasonality. The ARIMA models were validated. The most realistic models were selected for each function for forecasting. Finally, the short run six-month forecast was conducted on the trajectory of the acceleration of fatalities for all the selected best ARIMA models. Results: It was found that the best ARIMA model for the acceleration functions were the seasonalized models. All functions suggest a general decrease in fatalities and the pace at which this change occurs will eventually slow down over the next six months. Conclusion: The decreasing fatalities over the next six-month period takes into consideration the direct impact of the confirmed infections. There is an early increase in acceleration for the forecast period, which suggests an increase in daily fatalities. The acceleration eventually reduces over the six-month period which shows that fatalities will eventually decrease. This gives health officials an idea on how the fatalities will be affected in the future as the trajectory of confirmed COVID-19 infections change.",Epidemic Forecasting

Therefore, from the COVID-19 dataset by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, we present a temporal analysis on the number of new cases and deaths among countries using artificial intelligence. Our approach incrementally models the cases using a hierarchical clustering that emphasizes country transitions between infection groups over time. Then, one can compare the current situation of a country against others that have already faced previous waves. By using our approach, we designed a transition index to estimate the most probable countries' movements between infectious groups to predict next wave trends.

A SINDy-LM modeling method that can effectively balance model complexity and prediction accuracy is proposed based on data-driven technique. First, the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical systems (SINDy) method is used to discover and describe the nonlinear functional relationship between the dynamic terms in the model in accordance with the observation data of the COVID-19 epidemic. Moreover, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is utilized to optimize the obtained model for improving the accuracy of the SINDy algorithm. Second, the obtained model, which is consistent with the logistic model in mathematical form with small errors and high robustness, is leveraged to review the epidemic situation in China. Otherwise, the evolution of the epidemic in Australia and Egypt is predicted, which demonstrates that this method has universality for constructing the global COVID-19 model. The proposed model is also compared with the extreme learning machine (ELM), which shows that the prediction accuracy of the SINDy-LM method outperforms that of the ELM method and the generated model has higher sparsity.",Epidemic Forecasting;Transmission

The model can be used to explain slower approaching herd immunity, e.g., in Sweden, than it was predicted by a variety of other mathematical models and was expected by epidemiologists; see graphs Fig. 1, 2. The hierarchic structure of social clusters is mathematically modeled with ultrametric spaces having treelike geometry. To simplify mathematics, we consider trees with the constant number p > 1 of branches leaving each vertex. Such trees are endowed with an algebraic structure, these are p -adic number fields. We apply theory of the p -adic diffusion equation to describe a virus spread in hierarchically clustered population. This equation has applications to statistical physics and microbiology for modeling dynamics on energy landscapes. To move from one social cluster (valley) to another, a virus (its carrier) should cross a social barrier between them. The magnitude of a barrier depends on the number of social hierarchy's levels composing this barrier. We consider linearly increasing barriers. A virus spreads rather easily inside a social cluster (say working collective), but jumps to other clusters are constrained by social barriers. This behavior matches with the COVID-19 epidemic, with its cluster spreading structure. Our model differs crucially from the standard mathematical models of spread of disease, such as the SIR-model; in particular, by notion of the probability to be infected (at time t in a social cluster C ). We present socio-medical specialties of the COVID-19 epidemic supporting our model.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34312464,Commuting in metapopulation epidemic modeling.,,"The COVID-19 pandemic led authorities all over the world to imposing travel restrictions both on a national and on an international scale. Understanding the effect of such restrictions requires analysis of the role of commuting and calls for a metapopulation modeling that incorporates both local, intra-community infection and population exchange between different locations. Standard metapopulation models are formulated as markovian processes, and as such they do not label individuals according to their original location. However, commuting from home to work and backwards (reverse commuting) is the main pattern of transportation. Thus, it is important to be able to accurately model the effect of commuting on epidemic spreading. In this study we develop a methodology for modeling bidirectional commuting of individuals, without keeping track of each individual separately and with no need of proliferation of number of compartments beyond those defined by the epidemiologic model. We demonstrate the method using a city map of the state of Israel. The presented algorithm does not require any special computation resources and it may serve as a basis for intervention strategy examination in various levels of complication and resolution. We show how to incorporate an epidemiological model into a metapopulation commuting scheme while preserving the internal logic of the epidemiological modeling. The method is general and independent on the details of the epidemiological model under consideration.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34312455,Improving prediction of COVID-19 evolution by fusing epidemiological and mobility data.,,"We are witnessing the dramatic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic which, unfortunately, go beyond the impact on the health system. Until herd immunity is achieved with vaccines, the only available mechanisms for controlling the pandemic are quarantines, perimeter closures and social distancing with the aim of reducing mobility. Governments only apply these measures for a reduced period, since they involve the closure of economic activities such as tourism, cultural activities, or nightlife. The main criterion for establishing these measures and planning socioeconomic subsidies is the evolution of infections. However, the collapse of the health system and the unpredictability of human behavior, among others, make it difficult to predict this evolution in the short to medium term. This article evaluates different models for the early prediction of the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic to create a decision support system for policy-makers. We consider a wide branch of models including artificial neural networks such as LSTM and GRU and statistically based models such as autoregressive (AR) or ARIMA. Moreover, several consensus strategies to ensemble all models into one system are proposed to obtain better results in this uncertain environment. Finally, a multivariate model that includes mobility data provided by Google is proposed to better forecast trend changes in the 14-day CI. A real case study in Spain is evaluated, providing very accurate results for the prediction of 14-day CI in scenarios with and without trend changes, reaching 0.93 [Formula: see text], 4.16 RMSE and 1.08 MAE.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

For example, the number of confirmed cases largely underestimates the number of infections, and deaths lag infections substantially, while test positivity rates tend to greatly overestimate prevalence. Representative random prevalence surveys, the only putatively unbiased source, are sparse in time and space, and the results can come with big delays. Reliable estimates of population prevalence are necessary for understanding the spread of the virus and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. We develop a simple Bayesian framework to estimate viral prevalence by combining several of the main available data sources. It is based on a discrete-time Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model with time-varying reproductive parameter. Our model includes likelihood components that incorporate data on deaths due to the virus, confirmed cases, and the number of tests administered on each day. We anchor our inference with data from random-sample testing surveys in Indiana and Ohio. We use the results from these two states to calibrate the model on positive test counts and proceed to estimate the infection fatality rate and the number of new infections on each day in each state in the United States. We estimate the extent to which reported COVID cases have underestimated true infection counts, which was large, especially in the first months of the pandemic. We explore the implications of our results for progress toward herd immunity.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Detailed scientific analysis of this event is currently underway to come. However, it is very important to have the right facts and figures to take all possible actions that are needed to avoid COVID-19. In the practice and application of big data sciences, it is always of interest to provide the best description of the data under consideration. The recent studies have shown the potential of statistical distributions in modeling data in applied sciences, especially in medical science. In this article, we continue to carry this area of research, and introduce a new statistical model called the arcsine modified Weibull distribution. The proposed model is introduced using the modified Weibull distribution with the arcsine-X approach which is based on the trigonometric strategy. The maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters of the new model are obtained and the performance these estimators are assessed by conducting a Monte Carlo simulation study. Finally, the effectiveness and utility of the arcsine modified Weibull distribution are demonstrated by modeling COVID-19 patients data. The data set represents the survival times of fifty-three patients taken from a hospital in China. The practical application shows that the proposed model out-classed the competitive models and can be chosen as a good candidate distribution for modeling COVID-19, and other related data sets.",Epidemic Forecasting
34310593,A mechanistic and data-driven reconstruction of the time-varying reproduction number: Application to the COVID-19 epidemic.,,"The effective reproduction number Reff is a critical epidemiological parameter that characterizes the transmissibility of a pathogen. However, this parameter is difficult to estimate in the presence of silent transmission and/or significant temporal variation in case reporting. This variation can occur due to the lack of timely or appropriate testing, public health interventions and/or changes in human behavior during an epidemic. This is exactly the situation we are confronted with during this COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we propose to estimate Reff for the SARS-CoV-2 (the etiological agent of the COVID-19), based on a model of its propagation considering a time-varying transmission rate. This rate is modeled by a Brownian diffusion process embedded in a stochastic model. The model is then fitted by Bayesian inference (particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method) using multiple well-documented hospital datasets from several regions in France and in Ireland. This mechanistic modeling framework enables us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the transmission rate of the COVID-19 based only on the available data. Except for the specific model structure, it is non-specifically assumed that the transmission rate follows a basic stochastic process constrained by the observations. This approach allows us to follow both the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and the temporal evolution of its Reff(t). Besides, it allows to assess and to interpret the evolution of transmission with respect to the mitigation strategies implemented to control the epidemic waves in France and in Ireland. We can thus estimate a reduction of more than 80% for the first wave in all the studied regions but a smaller reduction for the second wave when the epidemic was less active, around 45% in France but just 20% in Ireland. For the third wave in Ireland the reduction was again significant (>70%).",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission
34310590,Projecting contact matrices in 177 geographical regions: An update and comparison with empirical data for the COVID-19 era.,,"Mathematical models have played a key role in understanding the spread of directly-transmissible infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as the effectiveness of public health responses. As the risk of contracting directly-transmitted infections depends on who interacts with whom, mathematical models often use contact matrices to characterise the spread of infectious pathogens. These contact matrices are usually generated from diary-based contact surveys. However, the majority of places in the world do not have representative empirical contact studies, so synthetic contact matrices have been constructed using more widely available setting-specific survey data on household, school, classroom, and workplace composition combined with empirical data on contact patterns in Europe. In 2017, the largest set of synthetic contact matrices to date were published for 152 geographical locations. In this study, we update these matrices with the most recent data and extend our analysis to 177 geographical locations. Due to the observed geographic differences within countries, we also quantify contact patterns in rural and urban settings where data is available. Further, we compare both the 2017 and 2020 synthetic matrices to out-of-sample empirically-constructed contact matrices, and explore the effects of using both the empirical and synthetic contact matrices when modelling physical distancing interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the synthetic contact matrices show qualitative similarities to the contact patterns in the empirically-constructed contact matrices. Models parameterised with the empirical and synthetic matrices generated similar findings with few differences observed in age groups where the empirical matrices have missing or aggregated age groups. This finding means that synthetic contact matrices may be used in modelling outbreaks in settings for which empirical studies have yet to be conducted.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34310444,Effect of adjustment for case misclassification and infection date uncertainty on estimates of COVID-19 effective reproduction number.,,"BACKGROUND: Surveillance data captured during the COVID-19 pandemic may not be optimal to inform a public health response, because it is biased by imperfect test accuracy, differential access to testing, and uncertainty in date of infection. METHODS: We downloaded COVID-19 time series surveillance data from the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment by report and illness onset dates for 9-Mar-2020 to 30-Sep-2020. We used existing Bayesian methods to first adjust for misclassification in testing and surveillance, followed by deconvolution of date of infection. We propagated forward uncertainty from each step corresponding to 10,000 posterior time-series of doubly adjusted epidemic curves. The effective reproduction number (Rt), a parameter of principal interest in tracking the pandemic, gauged the impact of the adjustment on inference. RESULTS: Observed period prevalence was 1.3%; median of the posterior of true (adjusted) prevalence was 1.7% (95% credible interval [CrI]: 1.4%, 1.8%). Sensitivity of surveillance declined over the course of the epidemic from a median of 88.8% (95% CrI: 86.3%, 89.8%) to a median of 60.8% (95% CrI: 60.1%, 62.6%). The mean (minimum, maximum) values of Rt were higher and more variable by report date, 1.12 (0.77, 4.13), compared to those following adjustment, 1.05 (0.89, 1.73). The epidemic curve by report date tended to overestimate Rt early on and be more susceptible to fluctuations in data. CONCLUSION: Adjusting for epidemic curves based on surveillance data is necessary if estimates of missed cases and the effective reproduction number play a role in management of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

There is apprehension on how to curb the spread and mitigate the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic, but timely and reliable daily confirmed cases' estimates are pertinent to the pandemic's containment. This study therefore conducted a situation assessment and applied simple predictive models to explore COVID-19 progression in Nigeria as at 31 May 2020. Methods: Data used for this study were extracted from the websites of the European Centre for Disease Control (World Bank data) and Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. Besides descriptive statistics, four predictive models were fitted to investigate the pandemic natural dynamics. Results: The case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 2.8%. A higher number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was reported daily after the relaxation of lockdown than before and during lockdown. Of the 36 states in Nigeria, including the Federal Capital Territory, 35 have been affected with COVID-19. Most active cases were in Lagos (n = 4064; 59.2%), followed by Kano (n = 669; 9.2%). The percentage of COVID-19 recovery in Nigeria (29.5%) was lower compared to South Africa (50.3%), but higher compared to Kenya (24.1%). The cubic polynomial model had the best fit. The projected value for COVID-19 cumulative cases for 30 June 2020 in Nigeria was 27,993 (95% C.I: 27,001-28,986). Conclusion: The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 are increasing in Nigeria. Increasing testing capacity for the disease may further reveal more confirmed cases. As observed in this study, the cubic polynomial model currently offers a better prediction of the future COVID-19 cases in Nigeria.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

For those regions that are currently free of infected cases, it is an urgent issue to prevent and control the local outbreak of COVID-19 when there are sporadic cases. To evaluate the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions against local transmission of COVID-19, and to forecast the epidemic dynamics after local outbreak of diseases under different control measures, we developed an individual-based model (IBM) to simulate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 from a microscopic perspective of individual-to-individual contacts to heterogenous among individuals. Based on the model, we simulated the effects of different levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions in controlling disease transmission after the appearance of sporadic cases. Simulations shown that isolation of infected cases and quarantine of close contacts alone would not eliminate the local transmission of COVID-19, and there is a risk of a second wave epidemics. Quarantine the second-layer close contacts can obviously reduce the size of outbreak. Moreover, to effectively eliminate the daily new infections in a short time, it is necessary to reduce the individual-to-individual contacts. IBM provides a numerical representation for the local transmission of infectious diseases, and extends the compartmental models to include individual heterogeneity and the close contacts network. Our study suggests that combinations of self-isolation, quarantine of close contacts, and social distancing would be necessary to block the local transmission of COVID-19.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Many researchers around the world incorporated various prediction techniques such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model, and Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA) to forecast the spread of this pandemic. The ARIMA technique was not heavily used in forecasting COVID-19 by researchers due to the claim that it is not suitable for use in complex and dynamic contexts. The aim of this study is to test how accurate the ARIMA best-fit model predictions were with the actual values reported after the entire time of the prediction had elapsed. We investigate and validate the accuracy of an ARIMA model over a relatively long period of time using Kuwait as a case study. We started by optimizing the parameters of our model to find a best-fit through examining auto-correlation function and partial auto correlation function charts, as well as different accuracy measures. We then used the best-fit model to forecast confirmed and recovered cases of COVID-19 throughout the different phases of Kuwait's gradual preventive plan. The results show that despite the dynamic nature of the disease and constant revisions made by the Kuwaiti government, the actual values for most of the time period observed were well within bounds of our selected ARIMA model prediction at 95% confidence interval. Pearson's correlation coefficient for the forecast points with the actual recorded data was found to be 0.996. This indicates that the two sets are highly correlated. The accuracy of the prediction provided by our ARIMA model is both appropriate and satisfactory.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Mathematical epidemic models can be utilized to forecast the course of an epidemic and cultivate approaches for controlling it. This paper utilizes the real data of spreading COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia for mathematical modeling and complex analyses. This paper introduces the Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered, Undetectable, and Deceased (SEIRUD) and Machine learning algorithm to predict and control COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.This COVID-19 has initiated many methods, such as cloud computing, edge-computing, IoT, artificial intelligence. The use of sensor devices has increased enormously. Similarly, several developments in solving the COVID-19 crisis have been used by IoT applications. The new technology relies on IoT variables and the roles of symptoms using wearable sensors to forecast cases of COVID-19. The working model involves wearable devices, occupational therapy, condition control, testing of cases, suspicious and IoT elements. Mathematical modeling is useful for understanding the fundamental principle of the transmission of COVID-19 and providing guidance for possible predictions.

The mathematical study results and related simulation are described here as a way of forecasting the progress and the possible end of the epidemic with three forms of scenarios: 'No Action,' 'Lockdowns and New Medicine.' The lock case slows it down the peak by minimizing infection and impacts area equality of the infected deformation. This study familiarizes the ideal protocol, which can support the Saudi population to breakdown spreading COVID-19 in an accurate and timely way.

Here we present a model that in addition to describing the dynamics of epidemic spreading with the traditional compartmental approach takes into account the social behaviour of the population distributed over a geographical region. The region to be modelled is defined as a two-dimensional grid of cells, in which each cell is weighted with the population density. In each cell a compartmental SEIRS system of delay difference equations is used to simulate the local dynamics of the disease. The infections between cells are modelled by a network of connections, which could be terrestrial, between neighbouring cells, or long range, between cities by air, road or train traffic. In addition, since people make trips without apparent reason, noise is considered to account for them to carry contagion between two randomly chosen distant cells. Hence, there is a clear separation of the parameters related to the biological characteristics of the disease from the ones that represent the spatial spread of infections due to social behaviour. We demonstrate that these parameters provide sufficient information to trace the evolution of the pandemic in different situations. In order to show the predictive power of this kind of approach we have chosen three, in a number of ways different countries, Mexico, Finland and Iceland, in which the pandemics have followed different dynamic paths. Furthermore we find that our model seems quite capable of reproducing the path of the pandemic for months with few initial data.

The marked difference between the lethality of the virus when comparing the first and second waves is an evident sign of the poor reliability of the data, also related to the variability over time in the number of performed swabs. During the early epidemic stage, swabs were made only to patients with severe symptoms taken to hospital or intensive care unit. Thus, asymptomatic people, not seeking medical assistance, remained undetected. Conversely, during the second wave of infection, total infectives included also a percentage of detected asymptomatic infectives, being tested due to close contacts with swab positives and thus registered by the health system. Here, we compared the outcomes of two SIR-type models (the standard SIR model and the A-SIR model that explicitly considers asymptomatic infectives) in reproducing the COVID-19 epidemic dynamic in Italy, Spain, Germany, and France during the first two infection waves, simulated separately. We found that the A-SIR model overcame the SIR model in simulating the first wave, whereas these discrepancies are reduced in simulating the second wave, when the accuracy of the epidemiological data is considerably higher. These results indicate that increasing the complexity of the model is useless and unnecessarily wasteful if not supported by an increased quality of the available data.",Epidemic Forecasting

These interventions and their relaxation have shaped the epidemic into a multi-phase form, namely an early invasion phase often followed by a lockdown phase, whose unlocking triggered a second epidemic wave, and so on. In this article, we provide a kinematic description of an epidemic whose time course is subdivided by mitigation interventions into a sequence of phases, on the assumption that interventions are effective enough to prevent the susceptible proportion to largely depart from 100% (or from any other relevant level). By applying this hypothesis to a general SIR epidemic model with age-since-infection and piece-wise constant contact and recovery rates, we supply a unified treatment of this multi-phase epidemic showing how the different phases unfold over time. Subsequently, by exploiting a wide class of infectiousness and recovery kernels allowing reducibility (either to ordinary or delayed differential equations), we investigate in depth a low-dimensional case allowing a non-trivial full analytical treatment also of the transient dynamics connecting the different phases of the epidemic. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results by a fit to the overall Italian COVID-19 epidemic since March 2020 till February 2021 i.e., before the mass vaccination campaign.

34297161,[A mathematical model to estimate the number of unreported SARS-CoV-2 infections in the early phase of the pandemic using Germany and Italy as examples].,covid-19;case fatality rate;epidemic modelling;prevalence estimation,"BACKGROUND: Especially in the early phase, it is difficult to obtain reliable figures on the spread of a pandemic. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated comprehensive but incomplete data monitoring provide a strong reason to estimate the number of unreported cases. AIM: The aim of this paper is to present a simple mathematical model that allows early estimation of the number of unregistered cases (underreporting). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prevalences of reported infections in different age groups are combined with additional assumptions on relative contact rates. From this, a corrected prevalence is derived for each age group, which can then be used to estimate the number of unreported cases. RESULTS: Our model derives for Germany in mid-April 2020 about 2.8 times more total infections than registered cases. For Italy, the model results in a factor of 8.3. The case mortalities derived from this are 0.98% for Germany and 1.51% for Italy, which are much closer together than the case mortalities of 2.7% and 12.6% derived purely from the number of reports available at that time. CONCLUSION: The number of unreported SARS-CoV-2-infected cases derived from the model can largely explain the difference in observations in case mortalities and of conditions in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and Italy. The model is simple, fast, and robust to implement, and can respond well when the reporting numbers are not representative of the population in terms of age structure. We suggest considering this model for efficient and early estimations of unreported case numbers in future epidemics and pandemics.",Epidemic Forecasting

Particular attention is devoted to the sensitivity and specificity of the serological test and their effects. Methods: The model satisfactory reproduces the data of the Italian survey showing a relevant predictive power and relegating in a secondary position models which do not include, in the simulation, the presence of asymptomatic groups. The corrections due to the serological test sensitivity (in particular those ones depending on the symptoms onset) are crucial for a realistic analysis of the unreported (and asymptomatic) components. Results: The relevant presence of an unreported component during the second pandemic wave in Italy is confirmed and the ratio of reported to unreported cases is predicted to be roughly 1:4 in the last months of year 2020. A method to correct the serological data on the basis of the antibody sensitivity is suggested and systematically applied. The asymptomatic component is also studied in some detail and its amount quantified. A model analyses of the vaccination scenarios is performed confirming the relevance of a massive campaign (at least 80000 immunized per day) during the first six months of the year 2021, to obtain important immunization effects within August/September 2021.",Epidemic Forecasting

Given the health facilities in the country, there are serious threats in the upcoming months which could be very testing for all the stakeholders. Therefore, there is a need to analyze and forecast the trends of COVID-19 in Pakistan. Methods: We have analyzed and forecasted the patterns of this pandemic in the country, for next 30 days, using Bayesian structural time series models. The causal impacts of lifting lockdown have also been investigated using intervention analysis under Bayesian structural time series models. The forecasting accuracy of the proposed models has been compared with frequently used autoregressive integrated moving average models. The validity of the proposed model has been investigated using similar datasets from neighboring countries including Iran and India. Results: We observed the improved forecasting accuracy of Bayesian structural time series models as compared to frequently used autoregressive integrated moving average models. As far as the forecasts are concerned, on August 10, 2020, the country is expected to have 333,308 positive cases with 95% prediction interval [275,034-391,077]. Similarly, the number of deaths in the country is expected to reach 7,187 [5,978-8,390] and recoveries may grow to 279,602 [208,420-295,740]. The lifting of lockdown has caused an absolute increase of 98,768 confirmed cases with 95% interval [85,544-111,018], during the post-lockdown period. The positive aspect of the forecasts is that the number of active cases is expected to decrease to 63,706 [18,614-95,337], on August 10, 2020. This is the time for the concerned authorities to further restrict the active cases so that the recession of the outbreak continues in the next month.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Here we show how to develop accurate models of COVID-19 transmission using Hawkes processes with spatial-temporal covariates. We model the conditional intensity of new COVID-19 cases and deaths in the U.S. at the county level, estimating the dynamic reproduction number of the virus within an EM algorithm through a regression on Google mobility indices and demographic covariates in the maximization step. We validate the approach on both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks, showing that the Hawkes process outperforms several models currently used to track the pandemic, including an ensemble approach and an SEIR-variant. We also investigate which covariates and mobility indices are most important for building forecasts of COVID-19 in the U.S.",Epidemic Forecasting

The present study aimed to estimate the actual number of cases with variant alpha and reconstruct the epidemiological dynamics. METHODS: The number of cases with variant alpha out of all PCR confirmed cases was estimated, employing a hypergeometric distribution. An exponential growth model was fitted to the growth data of variant alpha cases over fourteen weeks in Tokyo. RESULTS: The weekly incidence with variant alpha from 18-24 January 2021 was estimated at 4.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.7, 44.0) cases. The expected incidence in early May ranged from 420-1120 cases per week, and the reproduction number of variant alpha was on the order of 1.5 even under the restriction of contact from January-March, 2021, Tokyo. CONCLUSIONS: The variant alpha was predicted to swiftly dominate COVID-19 cases in Tokyo, and this has actually occurred by May 2021. Devising the proposed method, any country or location can interpret the virological sampling data.",Epidemic Forecasting

In the following months, the burden of this infection decreased significantly, possibly due to the impact of a package of interventions. We modeled the dynamics of COVID-19 infection in Iran to quantify the impacts of these interventions. METHODS: We used a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to model the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran, from January 21, 2020 to September 21, 2020. We estimated the 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Under different scenarios, we assessed the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) including physical distancing measures and self-isolation. We also estimated the time-varying reproduction number (Rt ), using our mathematical model and epidemiologic data. RESULTS: If no NPIs were applied, there could have been a cumulative number of 51 800 000 (95% UI: 1 910 000- 77 600 000) COVID-19 infections and 266 000 (95% UI: 119 000-476 000) deaths by September 21, 2020. If physical distancing interventions, such as school/border closures and self-isolation interventions had been introduced a week earlier than they were actually launched, 30.8% and 35.2% reduction in the number of deaths and infections respectively could have been achieved by September 21, 2020. The observed daily number of deaths showed that the Rt was one or more than one almost every day during the analysis period. CONCLUSION: Our models suggest that the NPIs implemented in Iran between January 21, 2020 and September 21, 2020 had significant effects on the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. Our study also showed that the timely implementation of NPIs showed a profound effect on further reductions in the numbers of infections and deaths. This highlights the importance of forecasting and early detection of future waves of infection and of the need for effective preparedness and response capabilities.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34273292,Estimating global and regional disruptions to routine childhood vaccine coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020: a modelling study.,,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission substantially affected health services worldwide. To better understand the impact of the pandemic on childhood routine immunisation, we estimated disruptions in vaccine coverage associated with the pandemic in 2020, globally and by Global Burden of Disease (GBD) super-region. METHODS: For this analysis we used a two-step hierarchical random spline modelling approach to estimate global and regional disruptions to routine immunisation using administrative data and reports from electronic immunisation systems, with mobility data as a model input. Paired with estimates of vaccine coverage expected in the absence of COVID-19, which were derived from vaccine coverage models from GBD 2020, Release 1 (GBD 2020 R1), we estimated the number of children who missed routinely delivered doses of the third-dose diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) vaccine and first-dose measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) in 2020. FINDINGS: Globally, in 2020, estimated vaccine coverage was 76.7% (95% uncertainty interval 74.3-78.6) for DTP3 and 78.9% (74.8-81.9) for MCV1, representing relative reductions of 7.7% (6.0-10.1) for DTP3 and 7.9% (5.2-11.7) for MCV1, compared to expected doses delivered in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic. From January to December, 2020, we estimated that 30.0 million (27.6-33.1) children missed doses of DTP3 and 27.2 million (23.4-32.5) children missed MCV1 doses. Compared to expected gaps in coverage for eligible children in 2020, these estimates represented an additional 8.5 million (6.5-11.6) children not routinely vaccinated with DTP3 and an additional 8.9 million (5.7-13.7) children not routinely vaccinated with MCV1 attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, monthly disruptions were highest in April, 2020, across all GBD super-regions, with 4.6 million (4.0-5.4) children missing doses of DTP3 and 4.4 million (3.7-5.2) children missing doses of MCV1. Every GBD super-region saw reductions in vaccine coverage in March and April, with the most severe annual impacts in north Africa and the Middle East, south Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. We estimated the lowest annual reductions in vaccine delivery in sub-Saharan Africa, where disruptions remained minimal throughout the year. For some super-regions, including southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania for both DTP3 and MCV1, the high-income super-region for DTP3, and south Asia for MCV1, estimates suggest that monthly doses were delivered at or above expected levels during the second half of 2020. INTERPRETATION: Routine immunisation services faced stark challenges in 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing the most widespread and largest global disruption in recent history. Although the latest coverage trajectories point towards recovery in some regions, a combination of lagging catch-up immunisation services, continued SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and persistent gaps in vaccine coverage before the pandemic still left millions of children under-vaccinated or unvaccinated against preventable diseases at the end of 2020, and these gaps are likely to extend throughout 2021. Strengthening routine immunisation data systems and efforts to target resources and outreach will be essential to minimise the risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks, reach children who missed routine vaccine doses during the pandemic, and accelerate progress towards higher and more equitable vaccination coverage over the next decade.

34271752,Nonuniversal power-law dynamics of susceptible infected recovered models on hierarchical modular networks.,,"Power-law (PL) time-dependent infection growth has been reported in many COVID-19 statistics. In simple susceptible infected recovered (SIR) models, the number of infections grows at the outbreak as I(t) proportional, variantt^{d-1} on d-dimensional Euclidean lattices in the endemic phase, or it follows a slower universal PL at the critical point, until finite sizes cause immunity and a crossover to an exponential decay. Heterogeneity may alter the dynamics of spreading models, and spatially inhomogeneous infection rates can cause slower decays, posing a threat of a long recovery from a pandemic. COVID-19 statistics have also provided epidemic size distributions with PL tails in several countries. Here I investigate SIR-like models on hierarchical modular networks, embedded in 2d lattices with the addition of long-range links. I show that if the topological dimension of the network is finite, average degree-dependent PL growth of prevalence emerges. Supercritically, the same exponents as those of regular graphs occur, but the topological disorder alters the critical behavior. This is also true for the epidemic size distributions. Mobility of individuals does not affect the form of the scaling behavior, except for the d=2 lattice, but it increases the magnitude of the epidemic. The addition of a superspreader hot spot also does not change the growth exponent and the exponential decay in the herd immunity regime.",Epidemic Forecasting

This multi-stage estimation of the model parameters offers a better model fit compared to the whole period analysis and shows how the COVID-19's infection patterns change over time, primarily depending on the effectiveness of the public health authority's non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). METHODS: This paper uses the SEIR(D) compartment model to simulate and estimate the parameters for three distinctive stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea, using a manually compiled COVID-19 epidemic dataset for the period between 18 February 2020 and 08 February 2021. The paper identifies three major stages of the COVID-19 epidemic, conducts multi-stage estimations of the SEIR(D) model parameters, and carefully infers context-dependent meaning of the estimation results to help better understand the unique patterns of the transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in each stage. RESULTS: The original SIR compartment model may produce a poor and even misleading estimation result if it is used to cover the entire period of the epidemic. However, if we use the model carefully in distinctive stages of the COVID-19 epidemic, we can find useful insights into the nature of the transmission of the novel coronavirus and the relative effectiveness of the government's non-pharmaceutical interventions over time.Key messagesIdentifies three distinctive waves of the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea.Conducts multi-stage estimations of the COVID-19 transmission dynamics using SEIR(D) epidemic models.The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 vary over time, primarily depending on the relative effectiveness of the government's non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).The SEIR(D) epidemic model is useful and informative, but only when it is used carefully to account for the presence of multiple waves and context-dependent infection patterns in each wave.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

For help to better planning of interventions, this study was conducted to forecast the number of daily new infected cases with COVID-19 for next thirty days in Iran. Methods: The information of observed Iranian new cases from 19th Feb to 30th Mar 2020 was used to predict the number of patients until 29(th) Apr. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were applied for prediction. The data was prepared from daily reports of Iran Ministry of Health and open datasets provided by the JOHN Hopkins. To compare models, dataset was separated into train and test sets. Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was the comparison criteria. Results: Both algorithms forecasted an exponential increase in number of newly infected patients. If the spreading pattern continues the same as before, the number of daily new cases would be 7872 and 9558 by 29(th) Apr, respectively by ANN and ARIMA. While Model comparison confirmed that ARIMA prediction was more accurate than ANN. Conclusion: COVID-19 is contagious disease, and has infected many people in Iran.

The extent to which confirmed cases can predict the morbidity and mortality in a society remains an unresolved issue. The research objective is therefore to test a generic model's predictability through time, based on percentage of confirmed cases on hospitalized patients, ICU patients and deceased. This study reports the explanatory and predictive ability of COVID-19-related healthcare data, such as whether there is a spread of a contagious and virulent virus in a society, and if so, whether the morbidity and mortality can be estimated in advance in the population. The model estimations stress the implementation of a pandemic strategy containing a proactive protocol entailing what, when, where, who and how countermeasures should be in place when a virulent virus (e.g. SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS) or pandemic strikes next time. Several lessons for the future can be learnt from the reported model estimations. One lesson is that COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality in a population is indeed predictable. Another lesson is to have a proactive protocol of countermeasures in place.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34264972,Predicting COVID-19 cases with unknown homogeneous or heterogeneous resistance to infectivity.,,"We present a restricted infection rate inverse binomial-based approach to better predict COVID-19 cases after a family gathering. The traditional inverse binomial (IB) model is inappropriate to match the reality of COVID-19, because the collected data contradicts the model's requirement that variance should be larger than the expected value. Our version of an IB model is more appropriate, as it can accommodate all potential data scenarios in which the variance is smaller, equal, or larger than the mean. This is unlike the usual IB, which accommodates only the scenario in which the variance is more than the mean. Therefore, we propose a refined version of an IB model to be able to accommodate all potential data scenarios. The application of the approach is based on a restricted infectivity rate and methodology on COVID-19 data, which exhibit two clusters of infectivity. Cluster 1 has a smaller number of primary cases and exhibits larger variance than the expected cases with a negative correlation of 28%, implying that the number of secondary cases is lesser when the number of primary cases increases and vice versa. The traditional IB model is appropriate for Cluster 1. The probability of contracting COVID-19 is estimated to be 0.13 among the primary, but is 0.75 among the secondary in Cluster 1, with a wider gap. Cluster 2, with a larger number of primary cases, exhibits smaller variance than the expected cases with a correlation of 79%, implying that the number of primary and secondary cases do increase or decrease together. Cluster 2 disqualifies the traditional IB model and requires its refined version. The probability of contracting COVID-19 is estimated to be 0.74 among the primary, but is 0.72 among the secondary in Cluster 2, with a narrower gap. The advantages of the proposed approach include the model's ability to estimate the community's health system memory, as future policies might reduce COVID's spread. In our approach, the current hazard level to be infected with COVID-19 and the odds of not contracting COVID-19 among the primary in comparison to the secondary groups are estimable and interpretable.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Despite extensive investments in research, no cure has been officially found to date. This uncertain situation rises severe threats to the survival of mankind. An ultimate need of the time is to investigate the course of disease transfer and suggest a future projection of the disease transfer to be enabled to effectively tackle the always evolving situations ahead.

It is of crucial importance to model an integrated/combined package of non-pharmaceutical (physical/social distancing) and pharmaceutical (immunization) public health control measures. A modified epidemiological, compartmental SIR model was used and fit to the cumulative COVID-19 case data for the province of Ontario, Canada, from 8 September 2020 to 8 December 2020. Different vaccine roll-out strategies were simulated until 75% of the population was vaccinated, including a no-vaccination scenario. We compete these vaccination strategies with relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Non-pharmaceutical interventions were supposed to remain enforced and began to be relaxed on 31 January, 31 March or 1 May 2021. Based on projections from the data and long-term extrapolation of scenarios, relaxing the public health measures implemented by re-opening too early would cause any benefits of vaccination to be lost by increasing case numbers, increasing the effective reproduction number above 1 and thus increasing the risk of localized outbreaks. If relaxation is, instead, delayed and 75% of the Ontarian population gets vaccinated by the end of the year, re-opening can occur with very little risk. Relaxing non-pharmaceutical interventions by re-opening and vaccine deployment is a careful balancing act. Our combination of model projections from data and simulation of different strategies and scenarios, can equip local public health decision- and policy-makers with projections concerning the COVID-19 epidemiological trend, helping them in the decision-making process.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34255772,A comprehensive estimation of country-level basic reproduction numbers R0 for COVID-19: Regime regression can automatically estimate the end of the exponential phase in epidemic data.,,"In a compartmental epidemic model, the initial exponential phase reflects a fixed interaction between an infectious agent and a susceptible population in steady state, so it determines the basic reproduction number R0 on its own. After the exponential phase, dynamic complexities like societal responses muddy the practical interpretation of many estimated parameters. The computer program ARRP, already available from sequence alignment applications, automatically estimated the end of the exponential phase in COVID-19 and extracted the exponential growth rate r for 160 countries. By positing a gamma-distributed generation time, the exponential growth method then yielded R0 estimates for COVID-19 in 160 countries. The use of ARRP ensured that the R0 estimates were largely freed from any dependency outside the exponential phase. The Prem matrices quantify rates of effective contact for infectious disease. Without using any age-stratified COVID-19 data, but under strong assumptions about the homogeneity of susceptibility, infectiousness, etc., across different age-groups, the Prem contact matrices also yielded theoretical R0 estimates for COVID-19 in 152 countries, generally in quantitative conflict with the R0 estimates derived from the exponential growth method. An exploratory analysis manipulating only the Prem contact matrices reduced the conflict, suggesting that age-groups under 20 years did not promote the initial exponential growth of COVID-19 as much as other age-groups. The analysis therefore supports tentatively and tardily, but independently of age-stratified COVID-19 data, the low priority given to vaccinating younger age groups. It also supports the judicious reopening of schools. The exploratory analysis also supports the possibility of suspecting differences in epidemic spread among different age-groups, even before substantial amounts of age-stratified data become available.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

So, it becomes necessary to predict the number of upcoming cases in future for the preparation of future plan-of-action and medical set-ups. The present manuscript proposed a hybrid fuzzy time series model for the prediction of upcoming COVID-19 infected cases and deaths in India by using modified fuzzy C-means clustering technique. Proposed model has two phases. In phase-I, modified fuzzy C-means clustering technique is used to form basic intervals with the help of clusters centroid while in phase-II, these intervals are upgraded to form sub-intervals. The proposed model is tested against available COVID-19 data for the measurement of its performance based on mean square error, root mean square error and average forecasting error rate. The novelty of the proposed model lies in the prediction of COVID-19 infected cases and deaths for next coming 31 days. Beside of this, estimation for the approximate number of isolation beds and ICU required has been carried out. The projection of the present model is to provide a base for the decision makers for making protection plan during COVID-19 pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34252078,Bayesian back-calculation and nowcasting for line list data during the COVID-19 pandemic.,,"Surveillance is critical to mounting an appropriate and effective response to pandemics. However, aggregated case report data suffers from reporting delays and can lead to misleading inferences. Different from aggregated case report data, line list data is a table contains individual features such as dates of symptom onset and reporting for each reported case and a good source for modeling delays. Current methods for modeling reporting delays are not particularly appropriate for line list data, which typically has missing symptom onset dates that are non-ignorable for modeling reporting delays. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach that dynamically integrates imputation and estimation for line list data. Specifically, this Bayesian approach can accurately estimate the epidemic curve and instantaneous reproduction numbers, even with most symptom onset dates missing. The Bayesian approach is also robust to deviations from model assumptions, such as changes in the reporting delay distribution or incorrect specification of the maximum reporting delay. We apply the Bayesian approach to COVID-19 line list data in Massachusetts and find the reproduction number estimates correspond more closely to the control measures than the estimates based on the reported curve.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Additionally, the concept of criticality over the infected population fraction in epidemics (or a pandemic) is introduced and its importance is discussed, highlighting the emergence of the critical slowdown phenomenon. A simple method is proposed for estimating how far away a population is from this ""singular"" state, by utilizing the theory of critical phenomena. Finally, a dynamic approach applying the self-organized diffusion model is proposed, resulting in more accurate simulations, which can verify the effectiveness of restrictive measures. All the above are supported by real epidemic data case studies.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We conduct a theoretical analysis of the stochastic model by the suitable Lyapunov function, including the existence and uniqueness of the positive solution, the dynamic properties around the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium; we deduce a stochastic basic reproduction number R0 (s) for the extinction of disease, that is, if R0 (s)</=1, the disease will go to extinction. Particularly, we fit the data from Brazil to predict the trend of the epidemic. Our main findings include the following: (i) stochastic perturbation may affect the dynamic behavior of the disease, and larger noise will be more beneficial to control its spread; (ii) strengthening social isolation, increasing the cure rate and media coverage can effectively control the spread of disease. Our results support the feasible ways of containing the outbreak of the epidemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

A substantial proportion of infections only lead to mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, but the proportion and infectivity of asymptomatic infections remains unknown. In this paper, we proposed a model to estimate the proportion and infectivity of asymptomatic cases, using COVID-19 in Henan Province, China, as an example. Methods: We extended the conventional susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model by including asymptomatic, unconfirmed symptomatic, and quarantined cases. Based on this model, we used daily reported COVID-19 cases from January 21 to February 26, 2020, in Henan Province to estimate the proportion and infectivity of asymptomatic cases, as well as the change of effective reproductive number, R t . Results: The proportion of asymptomatic cases among COVID-19 infected individuals was 42% and the infectivity was 10% that of symptomatic ones. The basic reproductive number R 0 = 2.73, and R t dropped below 1 on January 31 under a series of measures. Conclusion: The spread of the COVID-19 epidemic was rapid in the early stage, with a large number of asymptomatic infected individuals having relatively low infectivity. However, it was quickly brought under control with national measures.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

A range of factors and spatial-temporal terms are incorporated into the model. The non-linear and interactive effects of the neighborhood-level factors, i.e., population density and average of income, are modeled as a two-dimensional spline smoother. The change of spatial pattern over time is modeled as a three-dimensional tensor product smoother. By fitting this model, the space-time effect can uncover the underlying spatial-temporal pattern that is not explained by the covariates. The performance of the modeling method based on the individual data is also compared to the modeling methods based on the aggregated data in terms of in-sample and out-of-sample predictive checking. The results suggest that the individual-level based analysis provided a better overall model fit and higher predictive accuracy for detecting epidemic peaks in this application as compared to the analysis based on the aggregated data.",Epidemic Forecasting

People's social behavior, reflected in their mobility data, plays a major role in spreading the disease. Therefore, we used the daily mobility data aggregated at the county level beside COVID-19 statistics and demographic information for short-term forecasting of COVID-19 outbreaks in the United States. The daily data are fed to a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in the next two weeks. A significant average correlation was achieved (r=0.83 (p = 0.005)) between the model predicted and actual accumulated cases in the interval from August 1, 2020 until January 22, 2021. The model predictions had r > 0.7 for 87% of the counties across the United States. A lower correlation was reported for the counties with total cases of <1000 during the test interval. The average mean absolute error (MAE) was 605.4 and decreased with a decrease in the total number of cases during the testing interval. The model was able to capture the effect of government responses on COVID-19 cases. Also, it was able to capture the effect of age demographics on the COVID-19 spread. It showed that the average daily cases decreased with a decrease in the retiree percentage and increased with an increase in the young percentage. Lessons learned from this study not only can help with managing the COVID-19 pandemic but also can help with early and effective management of possible future pandemics.

Therefore, it is necessary to forecast and early warn the potential outbreak of COVID-19 in the future, which facilitates the timely implementation of appropriate control measures. However, real-time prediction of COVID-19 transmission and outbreaks is usually challenging because of its complexity intertwining both biological systems and social systems. Methods: By mining the dynamical information from region networks and the short-term time series data, we developed a data-driven model, the minimum-spanning-tree-based dynamical network marker (MST-DNM), to quantitatively analyze and monitor the dynamical process of COVID-19 spreading. Specifically, we collected the historical information of daily cases caused by COVID-19 infection in Italy from February 24, 2020 to November 28, 2020. When applied to the region network of Italy, the MST-DNM model has the ability to monitor the whole process of COVID-19 transmission and successfully identify the early-warning signals. The interpretability and practical significance of our model are explained in detail in this study. Results: The study on the dynamical changes of Italian region networks reveals the dynamic of COVID-19 transmission at the network level. It is noteworthy that the driving force of MST-DNM only relies on small samples rather than years of time series data. Therefore, it is of great potential in public surveillance for emerging infectious diseases.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

The model has two equilibrium points when the basic reproduction number R 0 > 1 ; a disease-free equilibrium E 0 and a disease endemic equilibrium E 1 . The disease-free equilibrium stage is locally and globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number R 0 < 1 , we show that the endemic equilibrium state is locally asymptotically stable if R 0 > 1 . We also prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution for the Atangana-Baleanu SIR model by using a fixed-point method. Since the Atangana-Baleanu fractional derivative gives better precise results to the derivative with exponential kernel because of having fractional order, hence, it is a generalized form of the derivative with exponential kernel. The numerical simulations are explored for various values of the fractional order. Finally, the effect of the ABC fractional-order derivative on suspected and infected individuals carefully is examined and compared with the real data.",Epidemic Forecasting

In today's interconnected global society, such contagion processes can cause global public health hazards, as exemplified by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. It is therefore of great practical relevance to investigate the network transmission of contagious diseases from the perspective of statistical inference. An important and widely studied boundary condition for contagion processes over networks is the so-called epidemic threshold. The epidemic threshold plays a key role in determining whether a pathogen introduced into a social contact network will cause an epidemic or die out. In this paper, we investigate epidemic thresholds from the perspective of statistical network inference. We identify two major challenges that are caused by high computational and sampling complexity of the epidemic threshold. We develop two statistically accurate and computationally efficient approximation techniques to address these issues under the Chung-Lu modeling framework. The second approximation, which is based on random walk sampling, further enjoys the advantage of requiring data on a vanishingly small fraction of nodes. We establish theoretical guarantees for both methods and demonstrate their empirical superiority.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In order to understand the dynamics of the spread of the disease, much effort has been made in terms of mathematical modeling. In this scenario, compartmental models are widely used to simulate epidemics under various conditions. In general, there are uncertainties associated with the reported data, which must be considered when estimating the parameters of the model. In this work, we propose an effective methodology for estimating parameters of compartmental models in multiple wave scenarios by means of a dynamic data segmentation approach. This robust technique allows the description of the dynamics of the disease without arbitrary choices for the end of the first wave and the start of the second. Furthermore, we adopt a time-dependent function to describe the probability of transmission by contact for each wave. We also assess the uncertainties of the parameters and their influence on the simulations using a stochastic strategy. In order to obtain realistic results in terms of the basic reproduction number, a constraint is incorporated into the problem. We adopt data from Germany and Italy, two of the first countries to experience the second wave of infections. Using the proposed methodology, the end of the first wave (and also the start of the second wave) occurred on 166 and 187 days from the beginning of the epidemic, for Germany and Italy, respectively. The estimated effective reproduction number for the first wave is close to that obtained by other approaches, for both countries. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is able to find good estimates for all parameters. In relation to uncertainties, we show that slight variations in the design variables can give rise to significant changes in the value of the effective reproduction number. The results provide information on the characteristics of the epidemic for each country, as well as elements for decision-making in the economic and governmental spheres.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In this paper, we propose a stochastic SEIHR (sSEIHR) model to describe such random fluctuations and provide sufficient conditions for stochastic stability of the disease-free equilibrium, based on the basic reproduction number that we estimated. Our extensive numerical results demonstrate strong threshold behavior near the estimated basic reproduction number, suggesting that the necessary conditions for stochastic stability are close to the sufficient conditions derived. Furthermore, we found that increasing the noise level slightly reduces the final proportion of infected individuals. In addition, we analyze COVID-19 data from various regions worldwide and demonstrate that by changing only a few parameter values, our sSEIHR model can accurately describe both the general trend and the random fluctuations in the number of daily new cases in each region, allowing governments and hospitals to make more accurate caseload predictions using fewer compartments and parameters than other comparable stochastic compartmental models.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We develop a heterogeneous compartmental model that accounts for the heterogeneity of the time-varying spread and severity of COVID-19 inside and outside LTC facilities, which is characterized by time-dependent stochastic processes and time-independent parameters in approximately 1500 dimensions after discretization. To infer these parameters, we use reported data on the number of confirmed, hospitalized, and deceased cases with suitable post-processing in both a deterministic inversion approach with appropriate regularization as a first step, followed by Bayesian inversion with proper prior distributions. To address the curse of dimensionality and the ill-posedness of the high-dimensional inference problem, we propose use of a dimension-independent projected Stein variational gradient descent method, and demonstrate the intrinsic low-dimensionality of the inverse problem. We present inference results with quantified uncertainties for both New Jersey and Texas, which experienced different epidemic phases and patterns. Moreover, we also present forecasting and validation results based on the empirical posterior samples of our inference for the future trajectory of COVID-19.",Epidemic Forecasting

Given emerging vaccines the aim of this study was to provide simple methods for estimating the hidden prevalence of asymptomatic cases and levels of herd immunity to aid future immunisation policy and planning. We applied the method in Ireland. METHODS: For large scale epidemics, indirect models for estimating prevalence have been developed. One such method is the benchmark multiplier method. A further method is back-calculation which has been used successfully to produce estimates of the scale of a HIV infected population. The methods were applied from March to October 2020 and are applicable globally. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that the number of infected individuals was at least twice and possibly six times the number identified through testing. Our estimates ranged from approximately 100,000 to 375,000 cases giving a ratio of 1 to 6 hidden cases for every known case within the study time frame. While both methods are subject to assumptions and limitations it was interesting to observe that estimates corroborated government statements noting that 80% of people testing positive were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: As Europe has now endured several epidemic waves with the emergence globally of new variants, it essential that both policy makers and the public are aware of the scale of the hidden epidemic that may surround them.

We aimed to formulate an applicable epidemiological model to accurately predict and forecast the impact of local outbreaks of COVID-19 to guide the local healthcare demand and capacity, policy-making and public health decisions. METHODS: The model utilized the aggregated daily COVID-19 situation reports (including counts of daily admissions, discharges and bed occupancy) from the local National Health Service (NHS) hospitals and COVID-19-related weekly deaths in hospitals and other settings in Sussex (population 1.7 million), Southeast England. These data sets corresponded to the first wave of COVID-19 infections from 24 March to 15 June 2020. A novel epidemiological predictive and forecasting model was then derived based on the local/regional surveillance data. Through a rigorous inverse parameter inference approach, the model parameters were estimated by fitting the model to the data in an optimal sense and then subsequent validation. RESULTS: The inferred parameters were physically reasonable and matched up to the widely used parameter values derived from the national data sets by Biggerstaff M, Cowling BJ, Cucunuba ZM et al. (Early insights from statistical and mathematical modeling of key epidemiologic parameters of COVID-19, Emerging infectious diseases. 2020;26(11)). We validate the predictive power of our model by using a subset of the available data and comparing the model predictions for the next 10, 20 and 30 days. The model exhibits a high accuracy in the prediction, even when using only as few as 20 data points for the fitting. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that by using local/regional data, our predictive and forecasting model can be utilized to guide the local healthcare demand and capacity, policy-making and public health decisions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the local population. Understanding how future COVID-19 spikes/waves could possibly affect the regional populations empowers us to ensure the timely commissioning and organization of services. The flexibility of timings in the model, in combination with other early-warning systems, produces a time frame for these services to prepare and isolate capacity for likely and potential demand within regional hospitals. The model also allows local authorities to plan potential mortuary capacity and understand the burden on crematoria and burial services. The model algorithms have been integrated into a web-based multi-institutional toolkit, which can be used by NHS hospitals, local authorities and public health departments in other regions of the UK and elsewhere.

34238721,Temporal trends and forecasting of COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths in Scotland using a national real-time patient-level data platform: a statistical modelling study.,,"BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, national-level surveillance platforms with real-time individual person-level data are required to monitor and predict the epidemiological and clinical profile of COVID-19 and inform public health policy. We aimed to create a national dataset of patient-level data in Scotland to identify temporal trends and COVID-19 risk factors, and to develop a novel statistical prediction model to forecast COVID-19-related deaths and hospitalisations during the second wave. METHODS: We established a surveillance platform to monitor COVID-19 temporal trends using person-level primary care data (including age, sex, socioeconomic status, urban or rural residence, care home residence, and clinical risk factors) linked to data on SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests, hospitalisations, and deaths for all individuals resident in Scotland who were registered with a general practice on Feb 23, 2020. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the association between clinical risk groups and time to hospitalisation and death. A survival prediction model derived from data from March 1 to June 23, 2020, was created to forecast hospital admissions and deaths from October to December, 2020. We fitted a generalised additive spline model to daily SARS-CoV-2 cases over the previous 10 weeks and used this to create a 28-day forecast of the number of daily cases. The age and risk group pattern of cases in the previous 3 weeks was then used to select a stratified sample of individuals from our cohort who had not previously tested positive, with future cases in each group sampled from a multinomial distribution. We then used their patient characteristics (including age, sex, comorbidities, and socioeconomic status) to predict their probability of hospitalisation or death. FINDINGS: Our cohort included 5 384 819 people, representing 98.6% of the entire estimated population residing in Scotland during 2020. Hospitalisation and death among those testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1 and June 23, 2020, were associated with several patient characteristics, including male sex (hospitalisation hazard ratio [HR] 1.47, 95% CI 1.38-1.57; death HR 1.62, 1.49-1.76) and various comorbidities, with the highest hospitalisation HR found for transplantation (4.53, 1.87-10.98) and the highest death HR for myoneural disease (2.33, 1.46-3.71). For those testing positive, there were decreasing temporal trends in hospitalisation and death rates. The proportion of positive tests among older age groups (>40 years) and those with at-risk comorbidities increased during October, 2020. On Nov 10, 2020, the projected number of hospitalisations for Dec 8, 2020 (28 days later) was 90 per day (95% prediction interval 55-125) and the projected number of deaths was 21 per day (12-29). INTERPRETATION: The estimated incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on positive tests recorded in this unique data resource has provided forecasts of hospitalisation and death rates for the whole of Scotland. These findings were used by the Scottish Government to inform their response to reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality.

In this short report we first estimate the underreporting factor for infections from publicly available data released by the Indian Council of Medical Research on reported number of cases and national seroprevalence surveys. We then use a compartmental epidemiologic model to estimate the undetected number of infections and deaths, yielding estimates of the corresponding underreporting factors. We compare the serosurvey based ad hoc estimate of the infection fatality rate (IFR) with the model-based estimate. Since the first and second waves in India are intrinsically different in nature, we carry out this exercise in two periods: the first wave (April 1, 2020-January 31, 2021) and part of the second wave (February 1, 2021-May 15, 2021). The latest national seroprevalence estimate is from January 2021, and thus only relevant to our wave 1 calculations. RESULTS: Both wave 1 and wave 2 estimates qualitatively show that there is a large degree of ""covert infections"" in India, with model-based estimated underreporting factor for infections as 11.11 (95% credible interval (CrI) 10.71-11.47) and for deaths as 3.56 (95% CrI 3.48-3.64) for wave 1. For wave 2, underreporting factor for infections escalate to 26.77 (95% CrI 24.26-28.81) and to 5.77 (95% CrI 5.34-6.15) for deaths. If we rely on only reported deaths, the IFR estimate is 0.13% for wave 1 and 0.03% for part of wave 2. Taking underreporting of deaths into account, the IFR estimate is 0.46% for wave 1 and 0.18% for wave 2 (till May 15). Combining waves 1 and 2, as of May 15, while India reported a total of nearly 25 million cases and 270 thousand deaths, the estimated number of infections and deaths stand at 491 million (36% of the population) and 1.21 million respectively, yielding an estimated (combined) infection fatality rate of 0.25%. There is considerable variation in these estimates across Indian states. Up to date seroprevalence studies and mortality data are needed to validate these model-based estimates.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Most countries have adopted ""lockdown"" policies to reduce the spatial spread of COVID-19, but they have damaged the economic and moral fabric of society. Mathematical modeling in non-pharmaceutical intervention policy management has proven to be a major weapon in this fight due to the lack of an effective COVID-19 vaccine. A new hybrid model for COVID-19 dynamics using both an age-structured mathematical model based on the SIRD model and spatio-temporal model in silico is presented, analyzing the data of COVID-19 in Israel. Using the hybrid model, a method for estimating the reproduction number of an epidemic in real-time from the data of daily notification of cases is introduced. The results of the proposed model are confirmed by the Israeli Lockdown experience with a mean square error of 0.205 over 2 weeks. The use of mathematical models promises to reduce the uncertainty in the choice of ""Lockdown"" policies.

34230884,Trajectory Simulation and Prediction of COVID-19 via Compound Natural Factor (CNF) Model in EDBF Algorithm.,,"Natural and non-natural factors have combined effects on the trajectory of COVID-19 pandemic, but it is difficult to make them separate. To address this problem, a two-stepped methodology is proposed. First, a compound natural factor (CNF) model is developed via assigning weight to each of seven investigated natural factors, that is temperature, humidity, visibility, wind speed, barometric pressure, aerosol, and vegetation in order to show their coupling relationship with the COVID-19 trajectory. Onward, the empirical distribution based framework (EDBF) is employed to iteratively optimize the coupling relationship between trajectory and CNF to express the real interaction. In addition, the collected data is considered from the backdate, that is about 23 days-which contains 14-days incubation period and 9-days invalid human response time-due to the nonavailability of prior information about the natural spreading of virus without any human intervention(s), and also lag effects of the weather change and social interventions on the observed trajectory due to the COVID-19 incubation period; Second, the optimized CNF-plus-polynomial model is used to predict the future trajectory of COVID-19. Results revealed that aerosol and visibility show the higher contribution to transmission, wind speed to death, and humidity followed by barometric pressure dominate the recovery rates, respectively. Consequently, the average effect of environmental change to COVID-19 trajectory in China is minor in all variables, that is about -0.3%, +0.3%, and +0.1%, respectively. In this research, the response analysis of COVID-19 trajectory to the compound natural interactions presents a new prospect on the part of global pandemic trajectory to environmental changes.",Epidemic Forecasting

To explore more about its aspects, we adopted the S E I R D (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Death) pandemic spread with a time delay on the heterogeneous population and geography in this work. Focusing on the spatial heterogeneity, epidemic spread on the framework of modeling that incorporates population movement within and across the boundaries is studied. The entire population of interest in a region is divided into small distinct geographical sub regions, which interact using migration networks across boundaries. Utilizing the time delay differential equations based model estimations, we analyzed the spread dynamics of disease in India. The numerical outcomes from the model are validated using real time available data for COVID-19 cases. Based on the developed model in the framework of the recent data, we verified total infection cases in India considering the effect of nationwide lockdown at the onset of the pandemic and its unlocking by what seemed to be the end of the first wave. We have forecasted the total number of infection cases in two extreme situations of nationwide no lockdown and strict lockdown scenario. We expect that in future for any change in the key parameters, due to the regional differences, predictions will lie within the bounds of the above mentioned extreme plots. We computed the approximate peak infection in forwarding time and relative timespan when disease outspread halts. The most crucial parameter, the time-dependent generalization of the basic reproduction number, has been estimated. The impact of the social distancing and restricted movement measures that are crucial to contain the pandemic spread has been extensively studied by considering no lockdown scenario. Our model suggests that attaining a reduction in the contact rate between susceptible and infected individuals by practicing strict social distancing is one of the most effective control measures to manage COVID-19 spread in India. The cases can further decrease if social distancing is followed in conjunction with restricted movement.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Its complexity is currently being exacerbated by the emerging COVID-19 pandemic and the threats of its second wave and looming third wave. We formulate and analyze a mathematical model incorporating some epidemiological features of the co-dynamics of both malaria and COVID-19. Sufficient conditions for the stability of the malaria only and COVID-19 only sub-models' equilibria are derived. The COVID-19 only sub-model has globally asymptotically stable equilibria while under certain condition, the malaria-only could undergo the phenomenon of backward bifurcation whenever the sub-model reproduction number is less than unity. The equilibria of the dual malaria-COVID19 model are locally asymptotically stable as global stability is precluded owing to the possible occurrence of backward bifurcation. Optimal control of the full model to mitigate the spread of both diseases and their co-infection are derived. Pontryagin's Maximum Principle is applied to establish the existence of the optimal control problem and to derive the necessary conditions for optimal control of the diseases. Though this is not a case study, simulation results to support theoretical analysis of the optimal control suggests that concurrently applying malaria and COVID-19 protective measures could help mitigate their spread compared to applying each preventive control measure singly as the world continues to deal with this unprecedented and unparalleled COVID-19 pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

This disease is posing a global threat, and almost every country in the world is now affected by this disease. Currently, there is no vaccine for this disease, and because of this, containing COVID-19 is not an easy task. It is noticed that elderly people got severely affected by this disease specially in Europe. In the present paper, we propose and analyze a mathematical model for COVID-19 virus transmission by dividing whole population in old and young groups. We find disease-free equilibrium and the basic reproduction number (R 0). We estimate the parameter corresponding to rate of transmission and rate of detection of COVID-19 using real data from Italy and Spain by least square method. We also perform sensitivity analysis to identify the key parameters which influence the basic reproduction number and hence regulate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Finally, we extend our proposed model to optimal control problem to explore the best cost-effective and time-dependent control strategies that can reduce the number of infectives in a specified interval of time.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Forecasting has been one of the most powerful statistical methods employed the world over in various disciplines for detecting and analyzing trends and predicting future outcomes based on which timely and mitigating actions can be undertaken. To that end, several statistical methods and machine learning techniques have been harnessed depending upon the analysis desired and the availability of data. Historically speaking, most predictions thus arrived at have been short term and country-specific in nature. In this work, multimodel machine learning technique is called EAMA for forecasting Covid-19 related parameters in the long-term both within India and on a global scale have been proposed. This proposed EAMA hybrid model is well-suited to predictions based on past and present data. For this study, two datasets from the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of India and Worldometers, respectively, have been exploited. Using these two datasets, long-term data predictions for both India and the world have been outlined, and observed that predicted data being very similar to real-time values.

Understanding the substantial differences observed in the trajectory of the disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is of critical importance at the moment. Numerous factors have been considered to explain the fact that symptoms vary highly among different people and the infection transmission rate varies among local populations. Virus replication within the host cell and the development of an immune response to virus antigens in the body are two interdependent processes, which have aftereffects and depend on the preexisting states of the cell and virus populations. Different scenarios with the same input parameters are necessary to consider for modeling the properties of the states. The efficiency of the immune response is the most important factor, including the time it takes to develop defense responses from three levels of the immune system, which is a complex system of the body. A computational description of infection scenarios was proposed on the basis of a delay differential equation with two values of the time lag. In the new model, transitions between phases of infectious disease depend on the initial virus dose and the delayed immune response to infection. A variation in the dose of the virus and response time can lead to a transition from an acute phase of the disease with overt symptoms to a chronic phase or fatal outcome. Asymptomatic transmission of viral infection was calculated and described in the model as a situation where the virus is rapidly and efficiently suppressed after a short replication phase, while still persisting in the body in minor amounts. An analysis of the model behavior is consistent with the theory that the initial number of virions can affect the quality of the immune response. The reasons that high individual differences are observed in the trajectory of COVID-19 disease and the formation of types of the immune response to coronavirus are still poorly understood. Known trajectories of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were used as a basis for model scenarios.",Epidemic Forecasting;Mechanism;Transmission

The novel methodology developed is based on the dynamic model known as Susceptible, Infected, Removed and Dead (SIRD). The model was modified to focus on the healthcare system dynamics, rather than modeling all cases of the disease. It was tuned using data available for each Brazilian state and updated with daily figures. A figure of merit that assesses the quality of the model fit to the data was defined and used to optimize the free parameters.

On 29th April 2020, Malaysia reported more than 5,000 COVID-19 cases; the second highest in the Southeast Asian region after Singapore. Recently, a forecasting model was developed to measure and predict COVID-19 cases in Malaysia on daily basis for the next 10 days using previously-confirmed cases. A Recurrent Forecasting-Singular Spectrum Analysis (RF-SSA) is proposed by establishing L and ET parameters via several tests. The advantage of using this forecasting model is it would discriminate noise in a time series trend and produce significant forecasting results. The RF-SSA model assessment was based on the official COVID-19 data released by the World Health Organization (WHO) to predict daily confirmed cases between 30th April and 31st May, 2020. These results revealed that parameter L = 5 (T/20) for the RF-SSA model was indeed suitable for short-time series outbreak data, while the appropriate number of eigentriples was integral as it influenced the forecasting results. Evidently, the RF-SSA had over-forecasted the cases by 0.36%. This signifies the competence of RF-SSA in predicting the impending number of COVID-19 cases. Nonetheless, an enhanced RF-SSA algorithm should be developed for higher effectivity of capturing any extreme data changes.",Epidemic Forecasting
34194512,Mortality and Excess Mortality: Improving FluMOMO.,,"FluMOMO is a universal formula to forecast mortality in 27 European countries and was developed on EuroMOMO context, http://www.euromomo.eu. The model has a trigonometric baseline and considers any upwards deviation from that to come from flu or extreme temperatures. To measure it, the model considers two variables: influenza activity and extreme temperatures. With the former, the model gives the number of deaths because of flu and with the latter the number of deaths because of extreme temperatures. In this article, we show that FluMOMO lacks important variables to be an accurate measure of all-cause mortality and flu mortality. Indeed, we found, as expected, that population ageing and exposure to the risk of death cannot be excluded from the linear predictor. We model weekly deaths as an autoregressive process (lag of one together with a lead of one week). This step allowed us to avoid FluMOMO trigonometric baseline and have a fit to weekly deaths through demographic variables. Our model uses data from Portugal between 2009 and 2020, on ISO-week basis. We use negative binomial-generalized linear models to estimate the weekly number of deaths as an alternative to traditional overdispersion Poisson. As explanatory variables were found to be statistically significant, we registered the number of deaths from the previous week, the influenza activity index, the population average age, the heat waves, the flu season, the number of deaths with COVID-19, and the population exposed to the risk of dying. Considering as excess mortality the number of deaths above the best estimate of deaths from our model, we conclude that excess mortality in 2020 (net of COVID-19 deaths, heat wave of July, and ageing) is low or inexistent. The model also allows us to have the number of deaths arising from flu and we conclude that FluMOMO is overestimating deaths from flu by 78%. Averages from the probability of dying are obtained as well as the probability of dying from flu. The latter is shown to be decreasing over time, probably due to the increase of flu vaccination. Higher mortality detected with the start of COVID-19, in March-April 2020, was probably due to COVID-19 deaths not recognized as COVID-19 deaths.",Epidemic Forecasting

During MarchJune 2020, we estimated unknown parameter values and generated scenario-based projections of future clinical care needs. Early coronavirus disease policy measures, including a stay-at-home order, were accompanied by substantial decreases in mobility and reduction of the effective reproductive number well below 1. When some restrictions were eased in late April, mobility increased to near baseline levels, but transmission remained low (effective reproductive number <1) through early June. Over time, our model was parameterized closer to reality in Colorado, leading to modest changes in estimates of intervention effects and more conservative long-term projections.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

The model is then fitted to current data and implemented using Runge-Kutta methods. Our computation results predict that the number of new cases would peak around mid-April 2020 and begin to abate by July provided that appropriate COVID-19 measures are promptly implemented and followed, and that the number of cases of COVID-19 might be significantly mitigated by having greater numbers of functional testing kits available for screening.

The approach is based on the theory of learning from errors, specifically adapted to the control of the virus spread by reducing infection rates using countermeasures such as medical treatment, isolation, social distancing etc. When these are effective, the infection rate, after reaching a peak, declines following what we call the Universal Recovery Curve. We use presently available data from many countries to make actual predictions of the recovery trend and time needed for securing minimum infection rates in the future. We claim that the trend of decline is direct evidence of learning about risk reduction, also in this case of the pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34189256,Modelling the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 with consideration of human mobility.,covid-19;epidemic dynamics;human mobility;social distancing,"So far COVID-19 has resulted in mass deaths and huge economic losses across the world. Various measures such as quarantine and social distancing have been taken to prevent the spread of this disease. These prevention measures have changed the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and introduced new challenges for epidemic modelling and prediction. In this paper, we study a novel disease spreading model with two important aspects. First, the proposed model takes the quarantine effect of confirmed cases on transmission dynamics into account, which can better resemble the real-world scenario. Second, our model incorporates two types of human mobility, where the intra-region human mobility is related to the internal transmission speed of the disease in the focal area and the inter-region human mobility reflects the scale of external infectious sources to a focal area. With the proposed model, we use the human mobility data from 24 cities in China and 8 states in the USA to analyse the disease spreading patterns. The results show that our model could well fit/predict the reported cases in both countries. The predictions and findings shed light on how to effectively control COVID-19 by managing human mobility behaviours.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

The said study is carried out by the consideration of a fractional-order epidemic model describing the dynamics of COVID-19 under a non-singular kernel type of derivative. The concerned model examine via non-singular fractional-order derivative known as Atangana-Baleanu derivative in Caputo sense (ABC). The problem analyzes for qualitative analysis and determines at least one solution by applying the approach of fixed point theory. The uniqueness of the solution is derived by the Banach contraction theorem. For iterative solution, the technique of iterative fractional-order Adams-Bashforth scheme is applied. Numerical simulation for the proposed scheme is performed at various fractional-order lying between 0, 1 and for integer-order 1. We also compare the compartmental quantities of the said model at two different effective contact rates of beta . All the compartments show convergence and stability with growing time. The simulation of the iterative techniques is also compared with the Laplace Adomian decomposition method (LADM).

On 18 December 2020, the South African government also announced the emergence of a new variant in a scenario similar to that of the UK, which is referred to as variant 501.V2. Another important milestone regarding this pandemic was the beginning, in December 2020, of vaccination campaigns in several countries. There are several vaccines, with different characteristics, developed by various laboratories and research centers. A natural question arises: what could be the impact of these variants and vaccines on the spread of COVID-19? Many models have been proposed to simulate the spread of COVID-19 but, to the best of our knowledge, none of them incorporates the effects of potential SARS-CoV-2 variants together with the vaccines in the spread of COVID-19. We develop here a theta - i j -SVEIHQRD mathematical model able to simulate the possible impact of this type of variants and of the vaccines, together with the main mechanisms influencing the disease spread. The model may be of interest for policy makers, as a tool to evaluate different possible future scenarios. We apply the model to the particular case of Italy (as an example of study case), showing different outcomes. We observe that the vaccines may reduce the infections, but they might not be enough for avoiding a new wave, with the current expected vaccination rates in that country, if the control measures are relaxed. Furthermore, a more contagious variant could increase significantly the cases, becoming the most common way of infection. We show how, even with the pandemic cases slowing down (with an effective reproduction number less than 1) and the disease seeming to be under control, the effective reproduction number of just the new variant may be greater than 1 and, eventually, the number of infections would increase towards a new disease wave. Therefore, a rigorous follow-up of the evolution of the number of infections with any potentially more dangerous new variant is of paramount importance at any stage of the pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Treatment

Recently, an explicit analytic, approximate expression (MT) for the peak time of the fraction of infected persons during an outbreak within the susceptible-infectious-recovered/removed (SIR) model had been presented and discussed (Turkyilmazoglu, 2021). There are three existing approximate solutions (SK-I, SK-II, and CG) of the semi-time SIR model in its reduced formulation that allow one to come up with different explicit expressions for the peak time of the infected compartment (Schlickeiser and Kroger, 2021; Carvalho and Goncalves, 2021). Here we compare the four expressions for any choice of SIR model parameters and find that SK-I, SK-II and CG are more accurate than MT as long as the amount of population to which the SIR model is applied exceeds hundred by far (countries, ss, cities). For small populations with less than hundreds of individuals (families, small towns), however, the approximant MT outperforms the other approximants. To be able to compare the various approaches, we clarify the equivalence between the four-parametric dimensional SIR equations and their two-dimensional dimensionless analogue. Using Covid-19 data from various countries and sources we identify the relevant regime within the parameter space of the SIR model.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

This approach uses simple and transparent statistical models to estimate the effect of NPIs on mobility, and basic machine learning methods to generate 10-day forecasts of COVID-19 cases. An advantage of the approach is that it involves minimal assumptions about disease dynamics, and requires only publicly-available data. We evaluate this approach using local and regional data from China, France, Italy, South Korea, and the United States, as well as national data from 80 countries around the world. We find that NPIs are associated with significant reductions in human mobility, and that changes in mobility can be used to forecast COVID-19 infections.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

These public health policy decisions were informed by statistical models for infection rates in national populations. In this work, we are interested in modelling the temporal evolution of national-level infection counts for the United Kingdom (UK-Wales, England, Scotland), Germany (GM), Italy (IT), Spain (SP), Japan (JP), Australia (AU) and the United States (US). We model the national-level infection counts for the period January 2020 to January 2021, thus covering both the pre- and post-vaccine roll-out periods, in order to better understand the most reliable model structure for the COVID-19 epidemic growth curve. We achieve this by exploring a variety of stochastic population growth models and comparing their calibration, with respect to in-sample fitting and out-of-sample forecasting, both with and without exposure adjustment, to the most widely used and reported growth model, the Gompertz population model, often referred to in the public health policy discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic. Model risk as we explore it in this work manifests in the inability to adequately capture the behaviour of the disease progression growth rate curve. Therefore, our concept of model risk is formed relative to the standard reference Gompertz model used by decision-makers, and then we can characterise model risk mathematically as having two components: the dispersion of the observation distribution, and the structure of the intensity function over time for cumulative counts of new infections daily (i.e. the force of infection) attributed directly to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also explore how to incorporate in these population models the effect that governmental interventions have had on the number of infected cases. This is achieved through the development of an exposure adjustment to the force of infection comprised of a purpose-built sentiment index, which we construct from various authoritative public health news reporting. The news reporting media we employed were the New York Times, the Guardian, the Telegraph, Reuters global blog, as well as national and international health authorities: the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organisation.

Based on these estimates, this work allows us to accurately re-estimate the lethality of the disease in Spain, taking into account unreported cases. METHODS: A hierarchical Bayesian model recently proposed in the literature has been adapted to model the actual number of Covid-19 cases in Spain. RESULTS: The results of this work show that the real load of Covid-19 in Spain in the period considered is well above the data registered by the public health system. Specifically, the model estimates show that, cumulatively until June 1st, 2020, there were 2 425 930 cases of Covid-19 in Spain with characteristics similar to those reported (95% credibility interval: 2 148 261 2 813 864), from which were actually registered only 518 664. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the results obtained from the second wave of the Spanish seroprevalence study, which estimates 2 350 324 cases of Covid-19 produced in Spain, in the period of time considered, it can be seen that the estimates provided by the model are quite good. This work clearly shows the key importance of having good quality data to optimize decision-making in the critical context of dealing with a pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting

We attempted to predict the scale of the latter half of the pandemic based on real data using the ratio between the early and latter halves from countries where the pandemic is largely over. We collected daily pandemic data from China, South Korea, and Switzerland and subtracted the ratio of pandemic days before and after the disease apex day of COVID-19. We obtained the ratio of pandemic data and created multiple regression models for the relationship between before and after the apex day. We then tested our models using data from the first wave of the disease from 14 countries in Europe and the US. We then tested the models using data from these countries from the entire pandemic up to March 30, 2021. Results indicate that the actual number of cases from these countries during the first wave mostly fall in the predicted ranges of liniar regression, excepting Spain and Russia. Similarly, the actual deaths in these countries mostly fall into the range of predicted data. Using the accumulated data up to the day of apex and total accumulated data up to March 30, 2021, the data of case numbers in these countries are falling into the range of predicted data, except for data from Brazil. The actual number of deaths in all the countries are at or below the predicted data.

Our results reveal that achieving a reduction in the contact rate between susceptible and infected individuals by isolated the uninfected individuals, can effectively reduce the number of daily confirmed cases. By combining the restrictive social distancing and contact tracing, the elimination of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is possible.

The first wave of the pandemic outbreak of the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in September 2019 and continued to March 2020. As declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), this virus affected populations all over the globe, and its accelerated spread is a universal concern. An ANN architecture was developed to predict the serious pandemic outbreak impact in Qatar, Spain, and Italy. Official statistical data gathered from each country until July 6th was used to validate and test the prediction model. The model sensitivity was analyzed using the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute percentage error and the regression coefficient index R(2), which yielded highly accurate values of the predicted correlation for the infected and dead cases of 0.99 for the dates considered. The verified and validated growth model of COVID-19 for these countries showed the effects of the measures taken by the government and medical sectors to alleviate the pandemic effect and the effort to decrease the spread of the virus in order to reduce the death rate. The differences in the spread rate were related to different exogenous factors (such as social, political, and health factors, among others) that are difficult to measure.

It has impacted almost all countries in the world. The major source of COVID-19 is a novel beta coronavirus. COVID-19 had a great impact on world throughout the year 2020. Now, the situation is becoming normal due to the invention of the vaccine. All major countries started large vaccination drives. Mathematical models are used to study the impact of different measures used to decrease pandemics. Mathematical models such as susceptible-infected-removed model and susceptible-exposed-infected-removed are used to predict the spread of diseases. But these models are not suitable to predict COVID-19 spread due to various preventive measures (social distancing and quarantine) applied to reduce spread. Hence, in the present manuscript, a novel fractional mathematical model with a social distancing parameter has been proposed to provide early COVID-19 spread estimation. Fractional calculus provides flexibility in choosing arbitrary order of derivative which controls data sensitivity. The model has been validated with real data set. It has been observed that the proposed model is highly accurate in spread estimation.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Then, the control reproduction number of general population epidemic model is obtained. Based on the epidemic model of general population, the epidemic model of general population and college population is further established, and the control reproduction number is also obtained. Methods: For the established epidemic model, firstly, the expression of the control reproduction number is obtained by using the next generation matrix. Secondly, the real-time reported data of COVID-19 in Shaanxi Province is used to fit the epidemic model, and the parameters in the model are estimated by least square method and MCMC. Thirdly, the Latin hypercube sampling method and partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) are adopted to analyze the sensitivity of the model. Conclusions: The control reproduction number remained at 3 from January 23 to January 31, then gradually decreased from 3 to slightly greater than 0.2 by using the real-time reports on the number of COVID-19 infected cases from Health Committee of Shaanxi Province in China. In order to further control the spread of the epidemic, the following measures can be taken: (i) reducing infection by wearing masks, paying attention to personal hygiene and limiting travel; (ii) improving isolation of suspected patients and treatment of symptomatic individuals. In particular, the epidemic model of the college population and the general population is established, and the control reproduction number is given, which will provide theoretical basis for the prevention and control of the epidemic in the colleges.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Mortality estimates at the local level are even more uncertain as they require stringent conditions, such as granularity and accuracy of the data at hand, which are rarely met. The ""official"" approach adopted by public institutions to estimate the ""excess mortality"" during the pandemic draws on a comparison between observed all-cause mortality data for 2020 and averages of mortality figures in the past years for the same period. In this paper, we apply the recently developed machine learning control method to build a more realistic counterfactual scenario of mortality in the absence of COVID-19. We demonstrate that supervised machine learning techniques outperform the official method by substantially improving the prediction accuracy of the local mortality in ""ordinary"" years, especially in small- and medium-sized municipalities. We then apply the best-performing algorithms to derive estimates of local excess mortality for the period between February and September 2020. Such estimates allow us to provide insights about the demographic evolution of the first wave of the pandemic throughout the country.

Based on the doubly interval-censored data model, we assume that the incubation period follows lognormal and Gamma distribution, and estimate the parameters of the incubation period of COVID-19 by adopting the maximum likelihood estimation, expectation maximization algorithm and a newly proposed algorithm (expectation mostly conditional maximization algorithm, referred as ECIMM). The main innovation of this paper lies in two aspects: Firstly, we regard the sample data of the incubation period as the doubly interval-censored data without unnecessary data simplification to improve the accuracy and credibility of the results; secondly, our new ECIMM algorithm enjoys better convergence and universality compared with others. With the framework of this paper, we conclude that 14-day quarantine period can largely interrupt the transmission of COVID-19, however, people who need specially monitoring should be isolated for about 20 days for the sake of safety. The results provide some suggestions for the prevention and control of COVID-19. The newly proposed ECIMM algorithm can also be used to deal with the doubly interval-censored data model appearing in various fields.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Covid-19 became a global pandemic, which led to a harmful impact on the world. Many predictive models of Covid-19 are being proposed by academic researchers around the world to take the foremost decisions and enforce the appropriate control measures. Due to the lack of accurate Covid-19 records and uncertainty, the standard techniques are being failed to correctly predict the epidemic global effects. To address this issue, we present an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based meta-analysis to predict the trend of epidemic Covid-19 over the world. The powerful machine learning algorithms namely Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Regression were applied on real time-series dataset, which holds the global record of confirmed, recovered, deaths and active cases of Covid-19 outbreak. Statistical analysis has also been conducted to present various facts regarding Covid-19 observed symptoms, a list of Top-20 Coronavirus affected countries and a number of coactive cases over the world. Among the three machine learning techniques investigated, Naive Bayes produced promising results to predict Covid-19 future trends with less Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The less value of MAE and MSE strongly represent the effectiveness of the Naive Bayes regression technique. Although, the global footprint of this pandemic is still uncertain. This study demonstrates the various trends and future growth of the global pandemic for a proactive response from the citizens and governments of countries. This paper sets the initial benchmark to demonstrate the capability of machine learning for outbreak prediction.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The generation interval and latent period, though both are of importance in understanding the features of COVID-19 transmission, are difficult to observe, and thus they can rarely be learnt from surveillance data empirically. In this study, we develop a likelihood framework to estimate the generation interval and incubation period simultaneously by using the contact tracing data of COVID-19 cases, and infer the pre-symptomatic transmission proportion and latent period thereafter. We estimate the mean of incubation period at 6.8 days (95 %CI: 6.2, 7.5) and SD at 4.1 days (95 %CI: 3.7, 4.8), and the mean of generation interval at 6.7 days (95 %CI: 5.4, 7.6) and SD at 1.8 days (95 %CI: 0.3, 3.8). The basic reproduction number is estimated ranging from 1.9 to 3.6, and there are 49.8 % (95 %CI: 33.3, 71.5) of the secondary COVID-19 infections likely due to pre-symptomatic transmission. Using the best estimates of model parameters, we further infer the mean latent period at 3.3 days (95 %CI: 0.2, 7.9). Our findings highlight the importance of both isolation for symptomatic cases, and for the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases.",Epidemic Forecasting;Transmission

In Indonesia, the B.1.1.7 cases have been found in several provinces since January 2021, although they are still in a lower number than the old variant of COVID-19. Therefore, this study aims to create a forecast analysis regarding the occasions of COVID-19 and B.1.1.7 cases based on data from the 1st January to 18th March 2021, and also analyze the association between meteorological factors with B.1.1.7 incidences in three different provinces of Indonesia such as the West Java, South Sumatra and East Kalimantan. METHODS: We used the Autoregressive Moving Average Models (ARIMA) to forecast the number of cases in the upcoming 14 days and the Spearman correlation analysis to analyze the relationship between B.1.1.7 cases and meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, sunshine, and wind speed. RESULTS: The results of the study showed the fitted ARIMA models forecasted there was an increase in the daily cases in three provinces. The total cases in three provinces would increase by 36% (West Java), 13.5% (South Sumatra), and 30% (East Kalimantan) as compared with actual cases until the end of 14 days later. The temperature, rainfall and sunshine factors were the main contributors for B.1.1.7 cases with each correlation coefficients; r = -0.230; p < 0.05, r = 0.211; p < 0.05 and r = -0.418; p < 0.01, respectively.

The kinetic description leads to study the evolution over time of Boltzmann-type equations describing the number densities of social contacts of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals, whose proportions are driven by a classical SIR-type compartmental model in epidemiology. Explicit calculations show that the spread of the disease is closely related to moments of the contact distribution. Furthermore, the kinetic model allows to clarify how a selective control can be assumed to achieve a minimal lockdown strategy by only reducing individuals undergoing a very large number of daily contacts. We conduct numerical simulations which confirm the ability of the model to describe different phenomena characteristic of the rapid spread of an epidemic. Motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic, a last part is dedicated to fit numerical solutions of the proposed model with infection data coming from different European countries.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We focus on the first year of the epidemic in Los Angeles County (LAC) (March 1, 2020-March 1, 2021), spanning three epidemic waves. A relative risk modeling approach was developed to estimate conditional effects from available marginal data. A dynamic stochastic epidemic model was developed to produce time-varying population estimates of epidemic parameters including the transmission and infection observation rate. The epidemic and risk models were integrated to produce estimates of subpopulation-stratified probabilities of disease progression and CFR and IFR for LAC. The probabilities of disease progression and CFR and IFR were found to vary as extensively between age groups as within age categories combined with the presence of absence of other risk factors, suggesting that it is inappropriate to summarize epidemiological parameters for age categories alone, let alone the entire population. The fine-grained subpopulation-stratified estimates of COVID-19 outcomes produced in this study are useful in understanding disparities in the effect of the epidemic on different groups in LAC, and can inform analyses of targeted subpopulation-level policy interventions.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

As of December 3, 2020, the total number of cases reported are around 65,527,000 contagions worldwide, and 1,524,000 deaths affecting 218 countries and territories. In this scenario, Spain is one of the countries that has suffered in a hard way, the ongoing epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, namely COVID-19 disease. In this paper, we present the utilization of phenomenological epidemic models to characterize the two first outbreak waves of COVID-19 in Spain. The study is driven using a two-step phenomenological epidemic approach. First, we use a simple generalized growth model to fit the main parameters at the early epidemic phase; later, we apply our previous finding over a logistic growth model to that characterize both waves completely.

It remains unclear whether models incorporating trends of digital searches lead to better predictions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between Google Trends searches of symptoms associated with COVID-19 and confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. We aim to develop predictive models to forecast the COVID-19 epidemic based on a combination of Google Trends searches of symptoms and conventional COVID-19 metrics. METHODS: An open-access web application was developed to evaluate Google Trends and traditional COVID-19 metrics via an interactive framework based on principal component analysis (PCA) and time series modeling. The application facilitates the analysis of symptom search behavior associated with COVID-19 disease in 188 countries. In this study, we selected the data of nine countries as case studies to represent all continents. PCA was used to perform data dimensionality reduction, and three different time series models (error, trend, seasonality; autoregressive integrated moving average; and feed-forward neural network autoregression) were used to predict COVID-19 metrics in the upcoming 14 days. The models were compared in terms of prediction ability using the root mean square error (RMSE) of the first principal component (PC1). The predictive abilities of models generated with both Google Trends data and conventional COVID-19 metrics were compared with those fitted with conventional COVID-19 metrics only. RESULTS: The degree of correlation and the best time lag varied as a function of the selected country and topic searched; in general, the optimal time lag was within 15 days. Overall, predictions of PC1 based on both search terms and COVID-19 traditional metrics performed better than those not including Google searches (median 1.56, IQR 0.90-2.49 versus median 1.87, IQR 1.09-2.95, respectively), but the improvement in prediction varied as a function of the selected country and time frame. The best model varied as a function of country, time range, and period of time selected. Models based on a 7-day moving average led to considerably smaller RMSE values as opposed to those calculated with raw data (median 0.90, IQR 0.50-1.53 versus median 2.27, IQR 1.62-3.74, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of digital online searches in statistical models may improve the nowcasting and forecasting of the COVID-19 epidemic and could be used as one of the surveillance systems of COVID-19 disease. We provide a free web application operating with nearly real-time data that anyone can use to make predictions of outbreaks, improve estimates of the dynamics of ongoing epidemics, and predict future or rebound waves.",Diagnosis;Epidemic Forecasting

Governments are rapidly evolving policies to increase hospital capacity and supply personal protective equipment and other equipment to mitigate disease spread in affected regions. Current models that predict COVID-19 case counts and spread are complex by nature and offer limited explainability and generalizability. This has highlighted the need for accurate and robust outbreak prediction models that balance model parsimony and performance. OBJECTIVE: We sought to leverage readily accessible data sets extracted from multiple states to train and evaluate a parsimonious predictive model capable of identifying county-level risk of COVID-19 outbreaks on a day-to-day basis. METHODS: Our modeling approach leveraged the following data inputs: COVID-19 case counts per county per day and county populations. We developed an outbreak gold standard across California, Indiana, and Iowa. The model utilized a per capita running 7-day sum of the case counts per county per day and the mean cumulative case count to develop baseline values. The model was trained with data recorded between March 1 and August 31, 2020, and tested on data recorded between September 1 and October 31, 2020. RESULTS: The model reported sensitivities of 81%, 92%, and 90% for California, Indiana, and Iowa, respectively. The precision in each state was above 85% while specificity and accuracy scores were generally >95%. CONCLUSIONS: Our parsimonious model provides a generalizable and simple alternative approach to outbreak prediction. This methodology can be applied to diverse regions to help state officials and hospitals with resource allocation and to guide risk management, community education, and mitigation strategies.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Indeed, due to such an increased attention, several software libraries and scientific tools have been developed to ease the access to epidemic modeling. However, only a handful of such resources were designed with the aim of providing a simple proxy for the study of the potential effects of public interventions (e.g., lockdown, testing, contact tracing). In this work, we introduce UTLDR, a framework that, overcoming such limitations, allows to generate ""what if"" epidemic scenarios incorporating several public interventions (and their combinations). UTLDR is designed to be easy to use and capable to leverage information provided by stratified populations of agents (e.g., age, gender, geographical allocation, and mobility patterns...).

More specifically, this study assesses whether crisis periods, particularly the coronavirus disease pandemic, influence the dynamic of cryptocurrency volatility. We investigate the four main cryptocurrency markets (Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic, Ethereum, and Ripple) from April 2018 to June 2020. The realized volatility measure is computed and decomposed to various components (continuous versus discontinuous, positive and negative semi-variances, and signed jumps). A variety of heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) models are developed including these components, thereby enabling assessment of different assumptions (including persistence and asymmetric dynamic) of modelling and volatility forecasting based on in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting strategies, respectively. Our results reveal three main findings. First, the extended HAR model that includes the positive and negative jumps appears to be the best model for predicting future volatility for both crisis and non-crisis periods. Second, during the crisis period, only the negative jump component is statistically significant. Third, in terms of volatility forecasting, the results show that the extended HAR model that includes positive and negative semi-variances outperform the other models.",Epidemic Forecasting

Surveillance data on COVID-19 deaths and case diagnoses are widely available in the public domain, but they are not used to model time to death because they typically do not link diagnosis and death at an individual level. This paper demonstrates that by comparing the unlinked patterns of new diagnoses and deaths over age and time, age-specific mortality and time to death may be estimated using a statistical method called deconvolution. METHODS: Age-specific data were analysed on 816 deaths among 6235 cases over age 50 years in Victoria, Australia, from the period January through December 2020. Deconvolution was applied assuming logistic dependence of case fatality risk (CFR) on age and a gamma time to death distribution. Non-parametric deconvolution analyses stratified into separate age groups were used to assess the model assumptions. RESULTS: It was found that age-specific CFR rose from 2.9% at age 65 years (95% CI:2.2 - 3.5) to 40.0% at age 95 years (CI: 36.6 - 43.6). The estimated mean time between diagnosis and death was 18.1 days (CI: 16.9 - 19.3) and showed no evidence of varying by age (heterogeneity P = 0.97). The estimated 90% percentile of time to death was 33.3 days (CI: 30.4 - 36.3; heterogeneity P = 0.85). The final age-specific model provided a good fit to the observed age-stratified mortality patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Deconvolution was demonstrated to be a powerful analysis method that could be applied to extensive data sources worldwide. Such analyses can inform transmission dynamics models and CFR assessment in emerging outbreaks. Based on these Australian data it is concluded that death from COVID-19 occurs within three weeks of diagnosis on average but takes five weeks in 10% of fatal cases. Fatality risk is negligible in the young but rises above 40% in the elderly, while time to death does not seem to vary by age.",Diagnosis;Epidemic Forecasting

METHODS: We investigate the intra-household transmission of COVID-19 through the secondary-attack rate (SAR) and household reproduction number (Rh). We estimate these using (i) data from 29 prior studies (February-August 2020), (ii) epidemiologically linked confirmed cases from Singapore (January-April 2020) and (iii) widespread-testing data from Vo' (February-March 2020). For (i), we use a Bayesian random-effects model that corrects for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test sensitivity and asymptomatic cases. We investigate the robustness of Rh with respect to community transmission rates and mobility patterns. RESULTS: The corrected pooled estimates from prior studies for SAR and Rh are 24% (20-28%) and 0.34 (0.30-0.38), respectively. Without corrections, the pooled estimates are: SAR = 18% (14-21%) and Rh = 0.28 (0.25-0.32). The corrected estimates line up with direct estimates from contact-tracing data from Singapore [Rh = 0.32 (0.22-0.42)] and population testing data from Vo' [SAR = 31% (28-34%) and Rh = 0.37 (0.34-0.40)]. The analysis of Singapore data further suggests that the value of Rh (0.22-0.42) is robust to community-spread dynamics; our estimate of Rh stays constant whereas the fraction of infections attributable to household transmission (Rh/Reff) is lowest during outbreaks (5-7%) and highest during lockdowns and periods of low community spread (25-30%). CONCLUSIONS: The three data-source types yield broadly consistent estimates for SAR and Rh. Our study suggests that household infections are responsible for a large fraction of infections and so household transmission may be an effective target for intervention.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

We present a mathematical model, namely PolSIRD, which accounts for the under-reporting by introducing an observation mechanism. It also captures the effects of intervention policies on the disease spread parameters by leveraging intervention policy data along with the reported disease cases. Furthermore, we allow our recurrent model to learn the initial hidden state of all compartments end-to-end along with other parameters via gradient-based training. We apply our model to the spread of the recent global outbreak of COVID-19 in the USA, where our model outperforms the methods employed by the CDC in predicting the spread. We also provide counterfactual simulations from our model to analyze the effect of lifting the intervention policies prematurely and our model correctly predicts the second wave of the epidemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The model assessed the role of denial on the spread of the pandemic in the world. Dynamic stability analyzes show that the equilibria, disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and endemic equilibrium point (EEP) of the model are globally asymptotically stable for R 0 < 1 and R 0 > 1 , respectively. Again, the model is shown via numerical simulations to possess the backward bifurcation, where a stable DFE co-exists with one or more stable endemic equilibria when the control reproduction number, R 0 is less than unity and the rate of denial of COVID-19 is above its upper bound. We then apply the optimal control strategy for controlling the spread of the disease using the controllable variables such as COVID-19 prevention, hospitalization and maximum treatment efforts. Using the Pontryagin maximum principle, we derive analytically the optimal controls of the model. The aforementioned control strategies are performed numerically in the presence of denial and without denial rate. Among such experiments, results without denial have shown to be more productive in ending the pandemic than others where the denial of the disease invalidates the effectiveness of the controls causing the disease to continue ravaging the globe.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

We conduct a case study based on data found in Canada to demonstrate how this modification, called Flight-SEIR, can potentially enable (1) early detection of outbreaks due to imported pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, (2) more accurate estimation of the reproduction number and (3) evaluation of the impact of travel restrictions and the implications of lifting these measures.

This work investigates dynamics in Lotka-Volterra based Models of COVID-19. The proposed models involve fractional derivatives which provide more adequacy and realistic description of the natural phenomena arising from such models. Existence and boundedness of non-negative solution of the fractional model is proved. Local stability is also discussed based on Matignon's stability conditions. Numerical results show that the fractional parameter has effect on flattening the curves of the coexistence steady state.

Policies that restrict travel within countries have been implemented, but the impact of these restrictions is not well known. On 4 May 2020, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) implemented travel restrictions such that non-residents required exemptions to enter the province. We fit a stochastic epidemic model to data describing the number of active COVID-19 cases in NL from 14 March to 26 June. We predicted possible outbreaks over nine weeks, with and without the travel restrictions, and for contact rates 40-70% of pre-pandemic levels. Our results suggest that the travel restrictions reduced the mean number of clinical COVID-19 cases in NL by 92%. Furthermore, without the travel restrictions there is a substantial risk of very large outbreaks. Using epidemic modelling, we show how the NL COVID-19 outbreak could have unfolded had the travel restrictions not been implemented. Both physical distancing and travel restrictions affect the local dynamics of the epidemic. Our modelling shows that the travel restrictions are a plausible reason for the few reported COVID-19 cases in NL after 4 May.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Analyses of the trend is highly need when the Chinese government makes plans and policies on epidemic control. This paper provides an estimation process on the trend of COVID-19 outbreak using the provincial-level data of the confirmed cases. On the basis of the previous studies, we introduce an effective and practical method to compute accurate basic reproduction numbers (R 0 s) in each province-level division of China. The statistical results show a non-stop downward trend of the R 0 s in China, and confirm that China has made significant progress on the epidemic control by lowering the provincial R 0 s from 10 or above to 3.21 or less. In the inferential analysis, we introduce an effective AR(n) model for the trend forecasting.

A new concept called the Term Structure for Turning Period (instead of Turning Point) is used for this study, and the framework, implemented into an individual SEIR (iSEIR) model, has enabled a timely prediction of the turning period when applied to Wuhan's COVID-19 epidemic, and provided the opportunity for relevant authorities to take appropriate and timely actions to successfully control the epidemic. By using the observed daily COVID-19 cases in Wuhan from January 23, 2020 to February 6 (and February 10), 2020 as inputs to the framework it allowed us to generate the trajectory of COVID-19 dynamics and to predict that the Turning Period of COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan would arrive within one week after February 14. This prediction turned out to be timely and accurate, which has provided adequate time for the government, hospitals and related sectors and services to meet peak demand and to prepare aftermath planning. We want to emphasize that emergency risk management entails the implementation of an emergency plan, where timing the Turning Period is key to express a clear timeline for effective actions. Our study confirms the observed effectiveness of Wuhan's Lockdown and Isolation control program imposed since January 23, 2020 to the middle of March, 2020 and resulted in swiftly flattened epidemic curve, and Wuhan's success offers an exemplary lesson for the world to learn in combating COVID-19 pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

There are multiple epidemiologic indicators used for discussing the spread of pandemics, one of these indicators is the basic reproductive ratio which indicates whether the pandemic is going to spread more or relax, and the aim of this work is estimating this ratio for the Middle East countries for two stages of the pandemic. Main body of the abstract: We employ Runge-Kutta method on SEIR model to simulate the basic reproductive ratio values of SARS-CoV-2 disease by using the recorded data of the disease for two stages, up to date May 29, 2020, in the first stage and up to date September 7, 2020, in the second stage. We estimate the coefficient of exposing rate, the coefficient of infection rate, the coefficient of recovery rate and the coefficient of mortality rate of the new coronavirus disease in addition to the basic reproductive ratio values of the disease in the Middle East countries, namely Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the Syrian Arab Republic, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Yemen where we apply the SEIR epidemic model. Short conclusion: We find that the values of the basic reproductive ratio of the new coronavirus disease based on the used model in the Middle East countries start from 1.5583 to 3.0395 in the first stage and from 1.0001 to 4.5757. Besides, we find that the problem of the new coronavirus disease in Lebanon and in the Syrian Arab Republic is not good at all in the recent stage based on the values of the basic reproductive ratio comparing with other Middle East countries. Also, we find that the value of the basic reproductive ratio for the second stage is near one; however, if we apply the method for the following stages, we find that the values return to be larger because lots of people in that stage and after did not follow the governmental procedures for stopping the spreading of the disease.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Nevertheless, NPI efficacy varies enormously between and within countries, mainly because of population and behavioral heterogeneity. In this work, we adapted a multi-group SEIRA model to study the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 in Chile, representing geographically separated regions of the country by different groups. We use national mobilization statistics to estimate the connectivity between regions and data from governmental repositories to obtain COVID-19 spreading and death rates in each region. We then assessed the effectiveness of different NPIs by studying the temporal evolution of the reproduction number R t . Analysing data-driven and model-based estimates of R t , we found a strong coupling of different regions, highlighting the necessity of organized and coordinated actions to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we evaluated different scenarios to forecast the evolution of COVID-19 in the most densely populated regions, finding that the early lifting of restriction probably will lead to novel outbreaks.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Interesting information can be obtained from the analysis of deviations in morbidity and mortality from the general dynamics. Comparison of the cases of morbidity or death for adjacent time intervals allows us to find out whether the changes in conditions were for short periods of time and whether the cases of morbidity or death were independent. The article consists of two parts: Study of the probability distribution (CDF) of the difference between two independent observations of the Poisson distribution; Application of the results to analyze the morbidity and mortality trends by day for the new coronavirus infection. For the distribution function of the module of difference between two independent observations of the Poisson distribution, an analytical expression has been obtained that allows to get an exact solution. A program has been created, whose software can be downloaded at http://1mgmu.com/nau/DeltaPoisson/DeltaPoisson.zip. An approximate solution that does not require complex calculations has also been obtained, which can be used for an average of more than 20. If real difference is greater than expected, it may be in the following cases: morbidity or mortality varies considerably during the day. That could happen, for example, if the registered number of morbidity on Saturday and Sunday is less than on weekdays due to the management model of the health system, or if the cases are not independent; for example, due to the active identification of infected people among those who have come into contact with the patient. If the difference is less than expected, it may be due to external limiting factors, such as a shortage of test systems for making a diagnosis, a limited number of pathologists to determine the cause of death, and so on. In the analysis of the actual data for COVID-19 it was found that for Poland and Russia, excluding Moscow, the difference in the number of cases and deaths is greater than expected, while for Moscow-less than expected. This may be due to the information policy-the effort to somehow reassure Moscow's population, which in the spring of 2020 had a high incidence rate of the new coronavirus infection.",Epidemic Forecasting

By 20th March, 2021, Pakistan reported 623,135 total confirmed cases and 13,799 deaths. A state space model called 'Bayesian Dynamic Linear Model' (BDLM) was used for the forecast of daily new infections, deaths and recover cases regarding COVID-19. For the estimation of states of the models and forecasting new observations, the recursive Kalman filter was used. Twenty days ahead forecast show that the maximum number of new infections are 4,031 per day with 95% prediction interval (3,319-4,743). Death forecast shows that the maximum number of the deaths with 95% prediction interval are 81 and (67-93), respectively. Maximum daily recoveries are 3,464 with 95% prediction interval (2,887-5,423) in the next 20 days. The average number of new infections, deaths and recover cases are 3,282, 52 and 1,840, respectively, in the upcoming 20 days.

Equipment shortages and varying testing capabilities have however hindered the usefulness of the official reported positive COVID-19 case counts. We introduce four complementary approaches to estimate the cumulative incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in each state in the US as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, using a combination of excess influenza-like illness reports, COVID-19 test statistics, COVID-19 mortality reports, and a spatially structured epidemic model. Instead of relying on the estimate from a single data source or method that may be biased, we provide multiple estimates, each relying on different assumptions and data sources. Across our four approaches emerges the consistent conclusion that on April 4, 2020, the estimated case count was 5 to 50 times higher than the official positive test counts across the different states. Nationally, our estimates of COVID-19 symptomatic cases as of April 4 have a likely range of 2.3 to 4.8 million, with possibly as many as 7.6 million cases, up to 25 times greater than the cumulative confirmed cases of about 311,000. Extending our methods to May 16, 2020, we estimate that cumulative symptomatic incidence ranges from 4.9 to 10.1 million, as opposed to 1.5 million positive test counts. The proposed combination of approaches may prove useful in assessing the burden of COVID-19 during resurgences in the US and other countries with comparable surveillance systems.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

An accurate prediction of its development trend is significant. We predicted the development trend of the second wave of COVID-19 in five European countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. We first built models to predict daily numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths based on the data of the first wave of COVID-19 in these countries. Based on these models, we built new models to predict the development trend of the second wave of COVID-19. We predicted that the second wave of COVID-19 would have peaked around on November 16, 2020, January 10, 2021, December 1, 2020, March 1, 2021, and January 10, 2021, in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK, respectively.

Our main aim is to show if the rise-in-cases proceeds in a gradual and staggered manner instead of soaring quickly then we can suppress the burden of the health system. In this new case study, we are attempting to show how to control the outbreak of the infectious disease COVID-19 via mathematical modeling. We have examined that the method of flattening the curve of the coronavirus, which increases the recovery rate of the infected individuals and also helps to decrease the number of deaths. In this pandemic situation, the countries like Russia, India, the United States of America (USA), South Africa, and the United Kingdom (UK) are leading in front where the virus is spreading in an unprecedented way. From our point of view, we establish that if these countries are following the method of flattening the curve like China and South Korea then these countries can also overcome this pandemic situation. Method: We propose a Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (SIR) mathematical model of infectious disease with onset data of COVID-19 in Wuhan and international cases, which has been propagated in Wuhan City to calculate the transmission rate of the infectious virus COVID-19 until now. To understand the whole dynamics of the transmission rate of coronavirus, we portray time series diagrams such as growth rate diagram, flattening the pandemic curve diagram, infected and recovered rate diagram, prediction of the transmission of the disease from the available dataset in Wuhan, and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. Results: We have observed that the basic reproduction number in Wuhan declined from 2.2 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.15-4.77) to 1.05 (0.41-2.39) and the mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% [CI], 4.1-7.0). Interestingly the mean value lies between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19. The doubling time of COVID-19 was registered 7.4 days (95% CI, 5.3-19) in the early stages and now the value decreases to -4.9 days. Similarly, we have observed the doubling time of the epidemic in South Korea decreased to -9.6 days. Currently, the doubling time of the epidemic in Russia, India, and the USA are 19.4 days, 16.4 days, and 41 days, respectively. We have investigated the growth rate of COVID-19 and plotted the curve flattening diagram against time. Conclusion: Via flattening the curve method, China and South Korea control the transmission of the fatal disease COVID-19 in the human population. Our results show that these two countries initially sustained pandemics in a large portion of the human population in the form of virus outbreaks that basically prevented the virus from spreading further and created ways to prevent community transmission. The majority portion of the people are perfectly fine, who are quarantined strictly and never get sick, but the portion of people who have developed symptoms is quickly isolated further.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

All have been impacted and countries are trying to recover from the social, economic, and health devastations of COVID-19. Recent epidemiology research has concentrated on using different prediction models to estimate the numbers of infected, recovered, and deceased cases around the world. This study is primarily focused on evaluating two common prediction models: Susceptible - Infected - Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Recovered (SEIR). The SIR and SEIR models were compared in estimating the outbreak and identifying the better fitting model for forecasting future spread in Kuwait. Based on the results of the comparison, the SEIR model was selected for predicting COVID-19 infected, recovered, and cumulative cases. The data needed for estimation was collected from official sites of the Kuwait Government between 24 February and 1 December 2020. This study presents estimated values for peak dates and expected eradication of COVID-19 in Kuwait. The proposed estimation model is simulated using the Python Programming language on the collected data. The simulation was performed with various basic reproduction numbers (between 5.2 and 3), the initial exposed population, and the incubation rate. The results show that the SEIR model was better suited than the SIR model for predicting both infection and recovery cases with R 0 values ranging from 3 to 4, E 0 = 80 and alpha = 0.2 .",Epidemic Forecasting

The complexity of these models increases as more components and variables are added to maintain and observe. Differential equations are regularly used in these models, as they are able to display the interactions between several variables and describe non-linear behaviour. Differential equations are commonly used in immune response mathematical models to help describe these complex and dynamic interactions within the immune system of the organism. Time delays in the immune system are common and are often disregarded due to the low-resolution of models, which provide limited description of the specific section of immune system being studied. The few models that incorporate time delays are mostly at the epidemiological level, to track the spread of the virus in the population. In this paper we review the applications of the models based on differential equations and describe their potential utilization for the studies of immune response in SARS-CoV-2.",Epidemic Forecasting

A mathematical model considering young and elder subpopulations under different fatality rates was formulated based on the natural history of CoViD-19 to study the transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The model considered susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, mild CoViD-19, severe CoViD-19, and recovered compartments, besides compartments of isolated individuals and those who were caught by test. This model was applied to study the epidemiological scenario resulting from the adoption of quarantine (isolation or lockdown) in many countries to control the rapid propagation of CoViD-19. We chose as examples the isolation adopted in Sao Paulo State (Brazil) in the early phase but not at the beginning of the epidemic, and the lockdown implemented in Spain when the number of severe CoViD-19 cases was increasing rapidly. Based on the data collected from Sao Paulo State and Spain, the model parameters were evaluated, and we obtained a higher estimation for the basic reproduction number R0 (9.24 for Sao Paulo State, and 8 for Spain) compared to the currently accepted estimation of R0 around 2 using the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered compartments) model. In comparison with the lockdown in Spain, the relatively early adoption of the isolation in Sao Paulo State resulted in enlarging the period of the first wave of the epidemic and delaying its peak. The model allowed to explain the flattening of the epidemic curves by quarantine when associated with the protective measures (face mask, washing hands with alcohol and gel, and social distancing) adopted by the population. The description of the epidemic under quarantine and protections can be a background to foreseen the epidemiological scenarios from the release strategies, which can help guide public health policies by decision-makers.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Model parameters were calibrated using an optimization technique with an objective function to minimize error associated with the cumulative cases of COVID-19 during a training period between March 15 and October 31, 2020. We outlined several case studies to demonstrate the model's state- and local-level projection capabilities. We further demonstrated how model outcomes could be used to evaluate perceived levels of COVID-19 risk across different localities using a multi-criteria decision analysis framework. The model's two, three, and four week out-of-sample projection errors varied on a state-by-state basis, and generally increased as the out-of-sample projection period was extended. Additionally, the prediction error in the state-level projections was generally due to an underestimation of cases and an overestimation of deaths.

The Grey Modelling (1,1) is a popular approach used to construct a predictive model with a small-sized dataset. In this study, a hybrid model based on grey prediction and rolling mechanism optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) was applied to create short-term estimates of the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases for three countries, Germany, Turkey, and the USA. A rolling mechanism that updates data in equal dimensions was applied to improve the forecasting accuracy of the models. The PSO algorithm was used to optimize the Grey Modelling parameters (1,1) to provide more robust and efficient solutions with minimum errors. To compare the accuracy of the predictive models, a nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NARNN) was also developed. According to the analysis results, Grey Rolling Modelling (1,1) optimized by PSO algorithm performs better than the classical Grey Modelling (1,1), Grey Rolling Modelling (1,1), and NARNN models for predicting the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The present study can provide an important basis for countries to allocate health resources and formulate epidemic prevention policies effectively.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

It first appeared in Wuhan, China, and then rapidly spread throughout the world. Since no treatment or preventative strategy has been identified until this time, millions of people across the world have been seriously affected by COVID-19. The modelling and prediction of confirmed COVID-19 cases have been given much attention by government policymakers for the purpose of combating it more effectively. For this purpose, the modelling and prediction performances of the linear model (LM), generalized additive model(GAM) and the time-varying linear model (Tv-LM) via Kalman filter are compared. This has never yet been undertaken in the literature. This comparative analysis also evaluates the linear relationship between the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in individual countries with the world. The analysis is implemented using daily COVID-19 confirmed rates of the top 8 most heavily affected countries and that of the world between 11 March and 21 December 2020 and 14-day forward predictions. The empirical findings show that the Tv-LM outperforms others in terms of model fit and predictability, suggesting that the relationship between each country's rates with the world's should be locally linear, not globally linear.",Epidemic Forecasting

SARS-CoV &MERS-CoV are painstaking, extremely pathogenic. Also, very evidently, both have been communicated from bats to palm-civets & dromedary camels and further transferred ultimately to humans. No country has been deprived of this viral genomic contamination wherever populaces reside and are interconnected. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of this viral genome. The analysis aids the study of the outbreak of this Virus towards the other parts of the continent and the world. The parameters such as population mobility, natural history, epidemiological characteristics, and the transmission mechanism towards viral spread when considered into crowd dynamism result in improved estimation. This article studies the impact of time on the amount of susceptible, exposed, the infected person taking into account asymptomatic and symptomatic ones; recovered i.e., removed from this model and the virus particles existing in the open surfaces. The transition from stable phase to attractor phase happens after 13 days i.e.; it takes nearly a fortnight for the spread to randomize among people. Further, the pandemic transmission remains in the attractor phase for a very long time if no control measures are taken up. The attractor-source phase continues up to 385 days i.e., more than a year, and perhaps stabilizes on 386th day as per the Lyapunov exponent's analysis. The time series helps to know the period of the Virus's survival in the open sources i.e. markets, open spaces and various other carriers of the Virus if not quarantined or sanitized. The Virus cease to exist in around 60 days if it does not find any carrier or infect more places, people etc. The changes in LCEs of all variables as time progresses for around 400 days have been forecasted. It can be observed that phase trajectories indicate how the two variables interact with each other and affect the overall system's dynamics. It has been observed that for exposed and asymptomatically infected (y-z), as exposed ones (y) change from 0 to 100 the value of asymptomatically infected (z) increased upto around 58, at exposed ones (y)=100, asymptomatically infected (z) has two values as 58 and 10 i.e. follows bifurcation and as exposed ones (y) changes values upto 180, the value of asymptomatically infected (z) decreases to 25 so for exposed ones (y) from 100 to 180, asymptomatically infected (z) varies from 58 to 25 to 10 follows bifurcation. Also, phase structures of exposed-symptomatically infected (y-u), exposed-removed (y-v), exposed-virus in the reservoir (y-w), asymptomatically infected-removed (z-v), symptomatically infected-removed (u-v) specifically depict bifurcations in various forms at different points. In case of asymptomatically infected-virus in the reservoir (z-w), at asymptomatically infected (z)=10, the value of viruses in the reservoir (w)=50, then as asymptomatically infected (z) increases to upto around 60. At this point, removed ones (v) increase from 50 to 70 and asymptomatically infected (z) decrease to 20 i.e., crosses the same value twice, which shows its limiting is known as limit cycle behavior and both the values tend to decrease towards zero. It shows a closed-loop limit cycle. Today, there has been no scientific revolution in the development of vaccination, nor has any antiviral treatment been successful, resulting in lack of its medication.

The health systems in the world collapsed in many countries due to the pandemic and many countries were negatively affected in the social life. In such situations, it is very important to predict the load that will occur in the health system of a country. In this study, the COVID-19 prevalence of Turkey is inspected. The infected cases, the number of deaths, and the recovered cases are predicted with Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in Turkey.

The data of early outbreak of COVID-19 were collected from the World Health Organizationcovering countries of the ChinaUnited StatesUnited KingdomAustraliaSerbia and Italy. The susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered SEIR model was generalized and then its parameters were optimized. According to the parameters in the basic infection number expressionthe sensitivity in the system dynamics model was used to quantitatively analyze the influence of the protection rateinfection rate and average quarantine time on the early spread of the outbreak. Based on the analysis resultstargeted prevention and control measures for the early outbreak of COVID-19 were proposed. The generalized SEIR model had a good fit for the early prediction and evaluation of COVID-19 outbreaks in six countries. The spread of COVID-19 was mainly affected by the protection rateinfection rate and average quarantine time. The improvement of the protection rate in the first ays was the most important:the greater the protection ratethe fewer the number of confirmed cases. The infection rate in the first 5 days was the most critical:the smaller the infection ratethe fewer the number of confirmed cases. The average quarantine time in the first 5 days was very important:the shorter the average quarantine timethe fewer the number of confirmed cases. Through the comparison of key parameters of six countriesAustralia and China had implemented strict epidemic prevention policieswhich had resulted in good epidemic prevention effects. In the early stage of the outbreakit is necessary to improve the protection rateshorten the average quarantine timeand implement strict isolation policies to curb the spread of COVID-19.,Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

A forecasting model generated based on detailed information from three countries during the initial phase of pandemic showed that progression rates from pneumonia to ARDS (PRPA) varied by country and were highly associated with CFR. We aim to elucidate the impact of the PRPA on COVID-19 deaths in different periods of pandemic. METHODS: We used the country-based, real-time global COVID-19 data through GitHub repository to estimate PRPA on the first period (January to June), second period (July to September), and third period (October to December) in 2020. PRPA was used for predicting COVID-19 deaths and assessing the reduction in deaths in subsequent two periods. RESULTS: The estimated PRPA varied widely from 0.38% to 51.36%, with an average of 15.99% in the first period. The PRPA declined to 8.44% and 6.35% in the second and third period. The CFR declined stepwise and was 4.94%, 2.61%, and 1.96%, respectively. Some countries exhibited a decrease in the PRPA from the second to the third period whereas others showed the opposite, particularly where selected viral mutants were prevalent. Overall, the number of observed deaths was lower than that of the predicted deaths in the second and third periods, suggesting an improvement in management of COVID-19 patients. Besides, the degree of improvement depends on the extent of change in PRPA. CONCLUSION: PRPA is a useful indicator to facilitate decision making and assess the improvement of clinical management and medical capacity by forecasting deaths.",Epidemic Forecasting

Because an unknown proportion of reported symptoms among SARS-CoV-2 positives will be attributable to another infection or affliction, the observed, or 'crude' proportion without symptoms may underestimate the proportion of persons without symptoms that are caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Based on two rounds of a large population-based serological study comprising test results on seropositivity and self-reported symptom history conducted in April/May and June/July 2020 in the Netherlands (n = 7517), we estimated the proportion of reported symptoms among those persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 that is attributable to this infection, where the set of relevant symptoms fulfills the ECDC case definition of COVID-19, using inferential methods for the attributable risk (AR). Generalised additive regression modelling was used to estimate the age-dependent relative risk (RR) of reported symptoms, and the AR and asymptomatic proportion (AP) were calculated from the fitted RR. RESULTS: Using age-aggregated data, the 'crude' AP was 37% but the model-estimated AP was 65% (95% CI 63-68%). The estimated AP varied with age, from 74% (95% CI 65-90%) for < 20 years, to 61% (95% CI 57-65%) for the 50-59 years age-group. CONCLUSION: Whereas the 'crude' AP represents a lower bound for the proportion of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 without COVID-19 symptoms, the AP as estimated via an attributable risk approach represents an upper bound. Age-specific AP estimates can inform the implementation of public health actions such as targetted virological testing and therefore enhance containment strategies.",Diagnosis;Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The challenges of immigration of new infections into regions and asymptomatic infections remain. Standard deterministic compartmental models are inappropriate for sub- or peri-critical epidemics (reproductive number close to or less than one), so individual-based models are often used by simulating transmission from an infected person to others. However, to be realistic, these models require a large number of parameters, each with its own set of uncertainties and lack of analytic tractability. Here, we apply stochastic age-structured Leslie theory with a long history in ecological research to provide some new insights to epidemic dynamics fuelled by external imports. We model the dynamics of an epidemic when R 0 is below one, representing COVID-19 transmission following the successful application of intervention measures, and the transmission dynamics expected when infections migrate into a region. The model framework allows more rapid prediction of the shape and size of an epidemic to improve scaling of the response. During an epidemic when the numbers of infected individuals are rapidly changing, this will help clarify the situation of the pandemic and guide faster and more effective intervention.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

This forced many affected countries to take stringent measures such as complete lockdown, shutting down businesses and trade, as well as travel restrictions, which has had a tremendous economic impact. Therefore, having knowledge and foresight about how a country might be able to contain the spread of COVID-19 will be of paramount importance to the government, policy makers, business partners and entrepreneurs. To help social and administrative decision making, a model that will be able to forecast when a country might be able to contain the spread of COVID-19 is needed. RESULTS: The results obtained using our long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based model are promising as we validate our prediction model using New Zealand's data since they have been able to contain the spread of COVID-19 and bring the daily new cases tally to zero. Our proposed forecasting model was able to correctly predict the dates within which New Zealand was able to contain the spread of COVID-19. Similarly, the proposed model has been used to forecast the dates when other countries would be able to contain the spread of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The forecasted dates are only a prediction based on the existing situation. However, these forecasted dates can be used to guide actions and make informed decisions that will be practically beneficial in influencing the real future. The current forecasting trend shows that more stringent actions/restrictions need to be implemented for most of the countries as the forecasting model shows they will take over three months before they can possibly contain the spread of COVID-19.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study from 37 geographically diverse US children's hospitals. We included ED encounters between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2020, transformed into time-series data. We constructed ensemble forecasting models of the most common presenting diagnoses and the most common diagnoses leading to admission, using data from 2010 through 2019. We then compared the most common presenting diagnoses and the most common diagnoses leading to admission in 2020 to the forecasts. RESULTS: 29,787,815 encounters were included, of which 1,913,085 (6.4%) occurred during 2020. ED encounters during 2020 were lower compared to prior years, with a 65.1% decrease in April relative to 2010-2019. In forecasting models, encounters for depression and diabetic ketoacidosis remained within the 95% confidence interval [CI]; fever, bronchiolitis, hyperbilirubinemia, skin/subcutaneous infections and seizures occurred within the 80-95% CI during the portions of 2020, and all other diagnoses (abdominal pain, otitis media, asthma, pneumonia, trauma, upper respiratory tract infections, and urinary tract infections) occurred below the predicted 95% CI. CONCLUSION: Pediatric ED utilization has remained low following the COVID-19 pandemic, and below forecasted utilization for most diagnoses. Nearly all conditions demonstrated substantial declines below forecasted rates from the prior decade and which persisted through the end of the year. Some declines in non-communicable diseases may represent unmet healthcare needs among children.

We propose the use of the golden steady state Kalman Filter, which is designed to have parameters related to the golden section. It was found that the proposed golden steady state Kalman Filter has a satisfactory behavior compared with the classical mean or average filter. Secondly, we deal with long term prediction, for example average prediction per quarantine period (14 days). We propose to process blocks of measurements of time window corresponding for example to the quarantine period in order to predict the average of cases and deaths using steady state Kalman Filter. It was found that the proposed golden steady state Kalman Filter produces more reliable predictions than the classical mean or average filter does. The use of steady state Kalman Filter for cases and deaths prediction of Covid-19 can be effective for resources and prevention measures planning.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

This study presents the use of machine learning techniques for projecting COVID-19 infections and deaths in Mexico. The research has three main objectives: first, to identify which function adjusts the best to the infected population growth in Mexico; second, to determine the feature importance of climate and mobility; third, to compare the results of a traditional time series statistical model with a modern approach in machine learning. The motivation for this work is to support health care providers in their preparation and planning. The methods compared are linear, polynomial, and generalized logistic regression models to describe the growth of COVID-19 incidents in Mexico. Additionally, machine learning and time series techniques are used to identify feature importance and perform forecasting for daily cases and fatalities. The study uses the publicly available data sets from the John Hopkins University of Medicine in conjunction with the mobility rates obtained from Google's Mobility Reports and climate variables acquired from the Weather Online API. The results suggest that the logistic growth model fits best the pandemic's behavior, that there is enough correlation of climate and mobility variables with the disease numbers, and that the Long short-term memory network can be exploited for predicting daily cases.

As compared to the basic SIR model, our model takes into account two possible routes of contagion transmission: direct from the infected compartment to the susceptible compartment and indirect via some intermediate medium or fomites. Transmission rates are estimated in terms of average distances between the individuals in selected social environments and characteristic time spans for which the individuals stay in each of these environments. We also introduce a collective economic resource associated with the average amount of money or income per individual to describe the socioeconomic interplay between the spreading process and the resource available to infected individuals. The epidemic-resource coupling is supposed to be of activation type, with the recovery rate governed by the Arrhenius-like law.

We propose an extended SEIR model and daily data of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and the seven largest European countries to forecast possible pandemic dynamics by investigating the effects of infection vulnerability stratification and measures on preventing the spread of infection. We assume that (i) the number of cases would be underestimated at the beginning of a new virus pandemic due to the lack of effective diagnostic methods and (ii) people more susceptible to infection are more likely to become infected; whereas during the later stages, the chances of infection among others will be reduced, thereby potentially leading to pandemic cessation. Based on infection vulnerability stratification, we demonstrate effects brought by the fraction of infected persons in the population at the start of pandemic deceleration on the cumulative fraction of the infected population. We interestingly show that moderate and long-lasting preventive measures are more effective than more rigid measures, which tend to be eventually loosened or abandoned due to economic losses, delay the peak of infection and fail to reduce the total number of cases. Our calculations relate the pandemic's second wave to high seasonal fluctuations and a low vulnerability stratification coefficient. Our characterisation of basic reproduction dynamics indicates that second wave of the pandemic is likely to first occur in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy, and a second wave is also possible in the U.K. and the U.S. Our findings show that even if the total elimination of the virus is impossible, the total number of infected people can be reduced during the deceleration stage.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34103618,A model and predictions for COVID-19 considering population behavior and vaccination.,,"The effect of vaccination coupled with the behavioral response of the population is not well understood. Our model incorporates two important dynamically varying population behaviors: level of caution and sense of safety. Level of caution increases with infectious cases, while an increasing sense of safety with increased vaccination lowers precautions. Our model accurately reproduces the complete time history of COVID-19 infections for various regions of the United States. We propose a parameter [Formula: see text] as a direct measure of a population's caution against an infectious disease that can be obtained from the infectious cases. The model provides quantitative measures of highest disease transmission rate, effective transmission rate, and cautionary behavior. We predict future COVID-19 trends in the United States accounting for vaccine rollout and behavior. Although a high rate of vaccination is critical to quickly ending the pandemic, a return towards pre-pandemic social behavior due to increased sense of safety during vaccine deployment can cause an alarming surge in infections. Our results predict that at the current rate of vaccination, the new infection cases for COVID-19 in the United States will approach zero by August 2021. This model can be used for other regions and for future epidemics and pandemics.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Treatment

Seasonal variation driven by responses to changing environment has been shown to affect the transmission intensity of several coronaviruses. However, the impact of the environment on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains largely unknown, and thus seasonal variation remains a source of uncertainty in forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we address this issue by assessing the association of temperature, humidity, ultraviolet radiation, and population density with estimates of transmission rate (R). Using data from the United States, we explore correlates of transmission across US states using comparative regression and integrative epidemiological modeling. We find that policy intervention (""lockdown"") and reductions in individuals' mobility are the major predictors of SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates, but, in their absence, lower temperatures and higher population densities are correlated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our results show that summer weather cannot be considered a substitute for mitigation policies, but that lower autumn and winter temperatures may lead to an increase in transmission intensity in the absence of policy interventions or behavioral changes. We outline how this information may improve the forecasting of COVID-19, reveal its future seasonal dynamics, and inform intervention policies.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission
34099741,SEAMHCRD deterministic compartmental model based on clinical stages of infection for COVID-19 pandemic in Sultanate of Oman.,,"The present novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has engendered a worldwide crisis on an enormous scale within a very short period. The effective solution for this pandemic is to recognize the nature and spread of the disease so that appropriate policies can be framed. Mathematical modelling is always at the forefront to understand and provide an adequate description of the transmission of any disease. In this research work, we have formulated a deterministic compartmental model (SEAMHCRD) including various stages of infection, such as Mild, Moderate, Severe and Critical to study the spreading of COVID-19 and estimated the model parameters by fitting the model with the reported data of ongoing pandemic in Oman. The steady-state, stability and final pandemic size of the model has been proved mathematically. The various transmission as well as transition parameters are estimated during the period from June 4th to July 30th, 2020. Based on the currently estimated parameters, the pandemic size is also predicted for another 100 days. Sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the key model parameters, and the parameter gamma due to contact with the symptomatic moderately infected is found to be more significant in spreading the disease. Accordingly, the corresponding basic reproduction number has also been computed using the Next Generation Matrix (NGM) method. As the value of the basic reproduction number (R0) is 0.9761 during the period from June 4th to July 30th, 2020, the disease-free equilibrium is stable. Isolation and tracing the contact of infected individuals are recommended to control the spread of disease.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission
34098928,Predicting the incidence of COVID-19 using data mining.,covid-19;data mining;predicting;prevalence,"BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of COVID-19 has made it a new pandemic. Predicting both its prevalence and incidence throughout the world is crucial to help health professionals make key decisions. In this study, we aim to predict the incidence of COVID-19 within a two-week period to better manage the disease. METHODS: The COVID-19 datasets provided by Johns Hopkins University, contain information on COVID-19 cases in different geographic regions since January 22, 2020 and are updated daily. Data from 252 such regions were analyzed as of March 29, 2020, with 17,136 records and 4 variables, namely latitude, longitude, date, and records. In order to design the incidence pattern for each geographic region, the information was utilized on the region and its neighboring areas gathered 2 weeks prior to the designing. Then, a model was developed to predict the incidence rate for the coming 2 weeks via a Least-Square Boosting Classification algorithm. RESULTS: The model was presented for three groups based on the incidence rate: less than 200, between 200 and 1000, and above 1000. The mean absolute error of model evaluation were 4.71, 8.54, and 6.13%, respectively. Also, comparing the forecast results with the actual values in the period in question showed that the proposed model predicted the number of globally confirmed cases of COVID-19 with a very high accuracy of 98.45%. CONCLUSION: Using data from different geographical regions within a country and discovering the pattern of prevalence in a region and its neighboring areas, our boosting-based model was able to accurately predict the incidence of COVID-19 within a two-week period.",Epidemic Forecasting
34098885,A comparison of five epidemiological models for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in India.,compartmental models;low and middle income countries;prediction uncertainty;statistical models,"BACKGROUND: Many popular disease transmission models have helped nations respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by informing decisions about pandemic planning, resource allocation, implementation of social distancing measures, lockdowns, and other non-pharmaceutical interventions. We study how five epidemiological models forecast and assess the course of the pandemic in India: a baseline curve-fitting model, an extended SIR (eSIR) model, two extended SEIR (SAPHIRE and SEIR-fansy) models, and a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model (ICM). METHODS: Using COVID-19 case-recovery-death count data reported in India from March 15 to October 15 to train the models, we generate predictions from each of the five models from October 16 to December 31. To compare prediction accuracy with respect to reported cumulative and active case counts and reported cumulative death counts, we compute the symmetric mean absolute prediction error (SMAPE) for each of the five models. For reported cumulative cases and deaths, we compute Pearson's and Lin's correlation coefficients to investigate how well the projected and observed reported counts agree. We also present underreporting factors when available, and comment on uncertainty of projections from each model. RESULTS: For active case counts, SMAPE values are 35.14% (SEIR-fansy) and 37.96% (eSIR). For cumulative case counts, SMAPE values are 6.89% (baseline), 6.59% (eSIR), 2.25% (SAPHIRE) and 2.29% (SEIR-fansy). For cumulative death counts, the SMAPE values are 4.74% (SEIR-fansy), 8.94% (eSIR) and 0.77% (ICM). Three models (SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM) return total (sum of reported and unreported) cumulative case counts as well. We compute underreporting factors as of October 31 and note that for cumulative cases, the SEIR-fansy model yields an underreporting factor of 7.25 and ICM model yields 4.54 for the same quantity. For total (sum of reported and unreported) cumulative deaths the SEIR-fansy model reports an underreporting factor of 2.97. On October 31, we observe 8.18 million cumulative reported cases, while the projections (in millions) from the baseline model are 8.71 (95% credible interval: 8.63-8.80), while eSIR yields 8.35 (7.19-9.60), SAPHIRE returns 8.17 (7.90-8.52) and SEIR-fansy projects 8.51 (8.18-8.85) million cases. Cumulative case projections from the eSIR model have the highest uncertainty in terms of width of 95% credible intervals, followed by those from SAPHIRE, the baseline model and finally SEIR-fansy. CONCLUSIONS: In this comparative paper, we describe five different models used to study the transmission dynamics of the SARS-Cov-2 virus in India. While simulation studies are the only gold standard way to compare the accuracy of the models, here we were uniquely poised to compare the projected case-counts against observed data on a test period. The largest variability across models is observed in predicting the ""total"" number of infections including reported and unreported cases (on which we have no validation data). The degree of under-reporting has been a major concern in India and is characterized in this report. Overall, the SEIR-fansy model appeared to be a good choice with publicly available R-package and desired flexibility plus accuracy.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

In spite of the efforts to stop the disease, being out of the control of the governments it spread rapidly all over the world. From then on, much research has been done in the world with the aim of controlling this contagious disease. A mathematical model for modeling the spread of COVID-19 and also controlling the spread of the disease has been presented in this paper. We find the disease-free equilibrium points as trivial equilibrium (TE), virus absenteeism equilibrium (VAE) and virus incidence equilibrium (VIE) for the proposed model; and at the trivial equilibrium point for the presented dynamic system we obtain the Jacobian matrix so as to be used in finding the largest eigenvalue. Radius spectral method has been used for finding the reproductive number. In the following, by adding a controller to the model and also using the theory of optimal control, we can improve the performance of the model. We must have a correct understanding of the system i.e. how it works, the various variables affecting the system, and the interaction of the variables on each other. To search for the optimal values, we need to use an appropriate optimization method. Given the limitations and needs of the problem, the aim of the optimization is to find the best solutions, to find conditions that result in the maximum of susceptiblity, the minimum of infection, and optimal quarantination.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

To this end, an extended susceptible-exposed-infected-vaccinated-recovered (SEIVR) epidemic model is first established deterministically, considering the quarantine and vaccination effects, and then applied to the available COVID-19 data from US. Afterwards, the prediction results are described as a time-series of the number of people infected, recovered, and dead. Upon introducing the extended SEIVR model into a limit-state function and defining the model parameters including transmission, recovery, and mortality rates as random variables, the problem is transformed into a reliability model and analyzed by the Monte Carlo sampling. The findings are subsequently given in the form of exceedance probabilities (EPs) of the three main outputs, namely, the maximum number of infected cases, the total number of recovered cases, and the total number of fatal cases. Afterwards, by incorporating time into the formulation of the reliability problem, the EPs are calculated over time and presented as 3D probability graphs, illustrating the relationship between the number of cases affected (i.e., infected, recovered, or dead), exceedance probability, and time. The results for the US demonstrate that, by the end of 2021, the number of the infected (active) cases decreases to 0.8 million and number of cases recovered and fatalities increases to 41.3 million and 0.6 million, respectively.",Epidemic Forecasting
34094795,The second and third waves in India: when will the pandemic be culminated?,,"An unprecedented upsurge of COVID-19-positive cases and deaths is currently being witnessed across India. According to WHO, India reported an average of 3.9 lakhs of new cases during the first week of May 2021 which equals 47% of new cases reported globally and 276 daily cases per million population. In this letter, the concept of SIR and fractal interpolation models is applied to predict the number of positive cases in India by approximating the epidemic curve, where the epidemic curve denotes the two-dimensional graphical representation of COVID-19-positive cases in which the abscissa denotes the time, while the ordinate provides the number of positive cases. In order to estimate the epidemic curve, the fractal interpolation method is implemented on the prescribed data set. In particular, the vertical scaling factors of the fractal function are selected from the SIR model. The proposed fractal and SIR model can also be explored for the assessment and modeling of other epidemics to predict the transmission rate. This letter investigates the duration of the second and third waves in India, since the positive cases and death cases of COVID-19 in India have been highly increasing for the past few weeks, and India is in a midst of a catastrophizing second wave. The nation is recording more than 120 million cases of COVID-19, but pandemics are still concentrated in most states. In order to predict the forthcoming trend of the outbreaks, this study implements the SIR and fractal models on daily positive cases of COVID-19 in India and its provinces, namely Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34092919,RLIM: a recursive and latent infection model for the prediction of US COVID-19 infections and turning points.,covid-19;recursive time series;seir;secondary infections;turning point,"Initially found in Hubei, Wuhan, and identified as a novel virus of the coronavirus family by the WHO, COVID-19 has spread worldwide at exponential speed, causing millions of deaths and public fear. Currently, the USA, India, Brazil, and other parts of the world are experiencing a secondary wave of COVID-19. However, the medical, mathematical, and pharmaceutical aspects of its transmission, incubation, and recovery processes are still unclear. The classical susceptible-infected-recovered model has limitations in describing the dynamic behavior of COVID-19. Hence, it is necessary to introduce a recursive, latent model to predict the number of future COVID-19 infection cases in the USA. In this article, a dynamic recursive and latent infection model (RLIM) based on the classical SEIR model is proposed to predict the number of COVID-19 infections. Given COVID-19 infection and recovery data for a certain period, the RLIM is able to fit current values and produce an optimal set of parameters with a minimum error rate according to actual reported numbers. With these optimal parameters assigned, the RLIM model then becomes able to produce predictions of infection numbers within a certain period. To locate the turning point of COVID-19 transmission, an initial value for the secondary infection rate is given to the RLIM algorithm for calculation. RLIM will then calculate the secondary infection rates of a continuous time series with an iterative search strategy to speed up the convergence of the prediction outcomes and minimize the maximum square errors. Compared with other forecast algorithms, RLIM is able to adapt the COVID-19 infection curve faster and more accurately and, more importantly, provides a way to identify the turning point in virus transmission by searching for the equilibrium between recoveries and new infections. Simulations of four US states show that with the secondary infection rate omega initially set to 0.5 within the selected latent period of 14 days, RLIM is able to minimize this value at 0.07 and reach an equilibrium condition. A successful forecast is generated using New York state's COVID-19 transmission, in which a turning point is predicted to emerge on January 31, 2021.

The vaccination control is applied when the basic reproduction number R 0 > 1 . The vaccination strategy is expressed as a state delayed feedback which is related to the current and previous state of the epidemic model, and makes the model become a linear system in new coordinates. For the presence and absence of vaccination control, we investigate the nonnegativity and boundedness of the model, respectively. We obtain some sufficient conditions for the eigenvalues of the linear system such that the nonnegativity of the epidemic model can be guaranteed when the vaccination strategy is applied. In addition, we study the stability of disease-free equilibrium when R 0 < 1 and the persistent of disease when R 0 > 1 . Finally, we use the obtained theoretical results to simulate the vaccination strategy to control the spread of COVID-19.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Treatment

In this article we use exponential, logistic, Gompertz growth and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to predict the spread of COVID-19 in India after the announcement of various unlock phases. The mean absolute percentage error and root mean square error comparative measures were used to check the goodness-of-fit of the growth models and Akaike information criterion for ARIMA model selection. Using COVID-19 pandemic data up to 20 December 2020 from India and its five most affected states (Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala), we report 15-days-ahead forecasts for cumulative confirmed cases and the number of deaths.

34090392,Estimating effective infection fatality rates during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany.,covid-19;dark figures;infection fatality rate;mortality;sars-cov-2,"BACKGROUND: The infection fatality rate (IFR) of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the most discussed figures in the context of this pandemic. In contrast to the case fatality rate (CFR), the IFR depends on the total number of infected individuals - not just on the number of confirmed cases. In order to estimate the IFR, several seroprevalence studies have been or are currently conducted. METHODS: Using German COVID-19 surveillance data and age-group specific IFR estimates from multiple international studies, this work investigates time-dependent variations in effective IFR over the course of the pandemic. Three different methods for estimating (effective) IFRs are presented: (a) population-averaged IFRs based on the assumption that the infection risk is independent of age and time, (b) effective IFRs based on the assumption that the age distribution of confirmed cases approximately reflects the age distribution of infected individuals, and (c) effective IFRs accounting for age- and time-dependent dark figures of infections. RESULTS: Effective IFRs in Germany are estimated to vary over time, as the age distributions of confirmed cases and estimated infections are changing during the course of the pandemic. In particular during the first and second waves of infections in spring and autumn/winter 2020, there has been a pronounced shift in the age distribution of confirmed cases towards older age groups, resulting in larger effective IFR estimates. The temporary increase in effective IFR during the first wave is estimated to be smaller but still remains when adjusting for age- and time-dependent dark figures. A comparison of effective IFRs with observed CFRs indicates that a substantial fraction of the time-dependent variability in observed mortality can be explained by changes in the age distribution of infections. Furthermore, a vanishing gap between effective IFRs and observed CFRs is apparent after the first infection wave, while an increasing gap can be observed during the second wave. CONCLUSIONS: The development of estimated effective IFR and observed CFR reflects the changing age distribution of infections over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Further research is warranted to obtain timely age-stratified IFR estimates, particularly in light of new variants of the virus.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Thus, Ct values from even limited numbers of random samples can provide improved estimates of an epidemic's trajectory. Combining data from multiple such samples improves the precision and robustness of such estimation.

In previous studies, predictions were investigated for single or several countries and territories. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop models that can be applied for real-time prediction of COVID-19 activity in all individual countries and territories worldwide. METHODS: Data of the previous daily incidence and infoveillance data (search volume data via Google Trends) from 215 individual countries and territories were collected. A random forest regression algorithm was used to train models to predict the daily new confirmed cases 7 days ahead. Several methods were used to optimize the models, including clustering the countries and territories, selecting features according to the importance scores, performing multiple-step forecasting, and upgrading the models at regular intervals. The performance of the models was assessed using the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Our models can accurately predict the daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in most countries and territories. Of the 215 countries and territories under study, 198 (92.1%) had MAEs <10 and 187 (87.0%) had Pearson correlation coefficients >0.8. For the 215 countries and territories, the mean MAE was 5.42 (range 0.26-15.32), the mean RMSE was 9.27 (range 1.81-24.40), the mean Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.89 (range 0.08-0.99), and the mean Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.84 (range 0.2-1.00).

Many researchers are in search for simple and realistic models to manage preventive resources and implement effective measures against hazardous circumstances. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has revealed the fact about deficiencies in health resource planning of some countries having relatively high case count and death toll. A unique epidemic model incorporating stochastic processes and queuing theory is presented, which was evaluated by computer simulation using pre-processed data obtained from an urban clinic providing family health services. Covid-19 data from a local corona-center was used as the initial model parameters (e.g. R0, infection rate, local population size, number of contacts with infected individuals, and recovery rate). A long-run trend analysis for 1 year was simulated. The results fit well to the current case data of the sample corona center. Effective preventive and reactive resource planning basically depends on accurately designed models, tools, and techniques needed for the prediction of feature threats, risks, and mitigation costs. In order to sufficiently analyze the transmission and recovery dynamics of epidemics it is important to choose concise mathematical models. Hence, a unique stochastic modeling approach tied to queueing theory and computer simulation has been chosen. The methods used here can also serve as a guidance for accurate modeling and classification of stages (or compartments) of epidemics in general.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Different modeling approaches have been proposed in an attempt to predict the behavior of these local cycles. Objective: This paper presents a framework to characterize the different variables that drive the local, or epidemic, cycles of the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to provide a set of relatively simple, yet efficient, statistical tools to be used by local health authorities to support decision making. Methods: Virtually closed cycles were compared to cycles in progress from different locations that present similar patterns in the figures that describe them. With the aim to compare populations of different sizes at different periods of time and locations, the cycles were normalized, allowing an analysis based on the core behavior of the numerical series. A model for the reproduction number was derived from the experimental data, and its performance was presented, including the effect of subnotification (ie, underreporting). A variation of the logistic model was used together with an innovative inventory model to calculate the actual number of infected persons, analyze the incubation period, and determine the actual onset of local epidemic cycles. Results: The similarities among cycles were demonstrated. A pattern between the cycles studied, which took on a triangular shape, was identified and used to make predictions about the duration of future cycles. Analyses on effective reproduction number (Rt) and subnotification effects for Germany, Italy, and Sweden were presented to show the performance of the framework introduced here. After comparing data from the three countries, it was possible to determine the probable dates of the actual onset of the epidemic cycles for each country, the typical duration of the incubation period for the disease, and the total number of infected persons during each cycle. In general terms, a probable average incubation time of 5 days was found, and the method used here was able to estimate the end of the cycles up to 34 days in advance, while demonstrating that the impact of the subnotification level (ie, error) on the effective reproduction number was <5%. Conclusions: It was demonstrated that, with relatively simple mathematical tools, it is possible to obtain a reliable understanding of the behavior of COVID-19 local epidemic cycles, by introducing an integrated framework for identifying cycle patterns and calculating the variables that drive it, namely: the Rt, the subnotification effects on estimations, the most probable actual cycles start dates, the total number of infected, and the most likely incubation period for SARS-CoV-2.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Based on data from the first epidemic wave of n = 20 countries (i.e., the United States, Canada, Australia, the EU-15 countries, Norway, and Switzerland), we estimate the relative reduction in the number of new infections attributed to each NPI. Among the NPIs considered, bans of large gatherings were most effective, followed by venue and school closures, whereas stay-at-home orders and work-from-home orders were least effective. With this retrospective cross-country analysis, we provide estimates regarding the effectiveness of different NPIs during the first epidemic wave.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The 2019 outbreak of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease COVID-19, has become a serious global pandemic. Many attempts have been made to forecast the spread of the disease using various methods, including time series models. Among the attempts to model the pandemic, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have used the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) technique to forecast confirmed cases. Objective: The primary objective of this paper is to construct a reliable, robust, and interpretable model for describing, decomposing, and forecasting the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and predicting the peak of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A modified singular spectrum analysis (SSA) approach was applied for the analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. We proposed this approach and developed it in our previous studies regarding the separability and grouping steps in SSA, which play important roles in reconstruction and forecasting. The modified SSA approach mainly enables us to identify the number of interpretable components required for separability, signal extraction, and noise reduction. The approach was examined using different levels of simulated and real data with different structures and signal-to-noise ratios. In this study, we examined the capability of the approach to analyze COVID-19 data. We then used vector SSA to predict new data points and the peak of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. Results: In the first stage, the confirmed daily cases on the first 42 days (March 02 to April 12, 2020) were used and analyzed to identify the value of the number of required eigenvalues (r) for separability between noise and signal. After obtaining the value of r, which was 2, and extracting the signals, vector SSA was used to predict and determine the pandemic peak. In the second stage, we updated the data and included 81 daily case values. We used the same window length and number of eigenvalues for reconstruction and forecasting of the points 90 days ahead. The results of both forecasting scenarios indicated that the peak would occur around the end of May or June 2020 and that the crisis would end between the end of June and the middle of August 2020, with a total number of infected people of approximately 330,000. Conclusions: Our results confirm the impressive performance of modified SSA in analyzing COVID-19 data and selecting the value of r for identifying the signal subspace from a noisy time series and then making a reliable prediction of daily confirmed cases using the vector SSA method.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

All countries have taken measures to control the spread of the epidemic. Because it is not known when the epidemic will end in several countries, then the prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic is a very important challenge. This study has predicted the temporal evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries using the logistic growth model. This model has analyzed several countries to describe the epidemic situation of these countries. The time interval of the actual data used as a comparison with the prediction results of this model was starting in the firstly confirmed COVID-19 cases to December 2020. This study examined an approach to the complexity spread of the COVID-19 pandemic using the logistic growth model formed from an ordinary differential equation. This model described the time-dependent population growth rate characterized by the three parameters of the analytical solution. The non-linear least-squares method was used to estimate the three parameters. These parameters described the rate growth constant of infected cases and the total number of confirmed cases in the final phase of the epidemic. This model is applied to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries. The prediction results show the spread dynamics of COVID-19 infected cases which are characterized by time-dependent dynamics. In this study, the proposed model provides estimates for the model parameters that are good for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic because they correspond to actual data for all analyzed countries. It is based on the coefficient of determination, R(2), and the R(2) value of more than 95% which is obtained from the non-linear curves for all analyzed countries.

In this work, a modified SIR epidemic model is proposed and analyzed with respect to the identification of its parameters and initial values based on stated or recorded case data from public health sources to estimate the unreported cases and the effectiveness of public health policies such as social distancing in slowing the spread of the epidemic. The analysis aims to highlight the importance of unreported cases for correcting the underestimated basic reproduction number.

However, the impact of each factor on the speed at which COVID-19 is spreading remains controversial. Accurate forecasting of potential positive cases may lead to better management of healthcare resources and provide guidelines for government policies in terms of the action required within an effective timeframe.

In this study, we propose a deep learning architecture to predict the spread of COVID-19 considering various factors, such as meteorological data and public mobility estimates, and applied it to data collected in Japan to demonstrate its effectiveness. The proposed model was constructed using a neural network architecture based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The model consists of multi-path LSTM layers that are trained using time-series meteorological data and public mobility data obtained from open-source data. The model was tested using different time frames, and the results were compared to Google Cloud forecasts. Public mobility is a dominant factor in estimating new positive cases, whereas meteorological data improve their accuracy. The average relative error of the proposed model ranged from 16.1% to 22.6% in major regions, which is a significant improvement compared with Google Cloud forecasting. This model can be used to provide public awareness regarding the morbidity risk of the COVID-19 pandemic in a feasible manner.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

As of 6 March, 90 cases were diagnosed in Hokkaido. Unfortunately, many infected persons may not have been recognized due to having mild or no symptoms during the initial months of the outbreak. We therefore aimed to predict the actual number of COVID-19 cases in (i) Hokkaido Prefecture and (ii) Sapporo city using data on cases diagnosed outside these areas. Two statistical frameworks involving a balance equation and an extrapolated linear regression model with a negative binomial link were used for deriving both estimates, respectively. The estimated cumulative incidence in Hokkaido as of 27 February was 2,297 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 382-7091) based on data on travelers outbound from Hokkaido. The cumulative incidence in Sapporo city as of 28 February was estimated at 2233 cases (95% CI: 0-4893) based on the count of confirmed cases within Hokkaido. Both approaches resulted in similar estimates, indicating a higher incidence of infections in Hokkaido than were detected by the surveillance system. This quantification of the gap between detected and estimated cases helped to inform the public health response at the beginning of the pandemic and provided insight into the possible scope of undetected transmission for future assessments.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Some emerging pathogens become avirulent as populations approach herd immunity. Although not all viruses follow this path, the fact that the seasonal coronaviruses are benign gives some hope. We develop a general mathematical model to predict when the interplay among three factors, correlation of severity in consecutive infections, population heterogeneity in susceptibility due to age, and reduced severity due to partial immunity, will promote avirulence as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic. Each of these components has the potential to limit severe, high-shedding cases over time under the right circumstances, but in combination they can rapidly reduce the frequency of more severe and infectious manifestation of disease over a wide range of conditions. As more reinfections are captured in data over the next several years, these models will help to test if COVID-19 severity is beginning to attenuate in the ways our model predicts, and to predict the disease.",Epidemic Forecasting

We developed a probabilistic model for estimating the proportion of undetected asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in the country. We considered two scenarios: one is conservative and the other is nonconservative. By combining the above two scenarios, we gave an interval estimation of 0.0001-0.0027 and in terms of the population, 5200-139,900 is the number of undetected asymptomatic cases in South Korea as of 2 February 2021. In addition, we provide estimates for total cases of COVID-19 in South Korea. Combination of undetected asymptomatic cases and undetected symptomatic cases to the number of confirmed cases (78,844 cases on 2 February 2021) shows that 0.17-0.42% (89,244-218,744) of the population have COVID-19. In conclusion, to control and understand the true ongoing reality of the pandemic, it is of outermost importance to focus on the ratio of undetected asymptomatic cases in the total population.",Epidemic Forecasting
34059063,A Bayesian spatio-temporal analysis of mortality rates in Spain: application to the COVID-19 2020 outbreak.,covid-19;excess of deaths;integrated nested laplace approximation;spatio-temporal models;standardized mortality ratios,"BACKGROUND: The number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 in Spain has been highly controversial since it is problematic to tell apart deaths having COVID as the main cause from those provoked by the aggravation by the viral infection of other underlying health problems. In addition, overburdening of health system led to an increase in mortality due to the scarcity of adequate medical care, at the same time confinement measures could have contributed to the decrease in mortality from certain causes. Our aim is to compare the number of deaths observed in 2020 with the projection for the same period obtained from a sequence of previous years. Thus, this computed mortality excess could be considered as the real impact of the COVID-19 on the mortality rates. METHODS: The population was split into four age groups, namely: (< 50; 50-64; 65-74; 75 and over). For each one, a projection of the death numbers for the year 2020, based on the interval 2008-2020, was estimated using a Bayesian spatio-temporal model. In each one, spatial, sex, and year effects were included. In addition, a specific effect of the year 2020 was added (""outbreak""). Finally, the excess deaths in year 2020 were estimated as the count of observed deaths minus those projected. RESULTS: The projected death number for 2020 was 426,970 people, the actual count being 499,104; thus, the total excess of deaths was 72,134. However, this increase was very unequally distributed over the Spanish regions. CONCLUSION: Bayesian spatio-temporal models have proved to be a useful tool for estimating the impact of COVID-19 on mortality in Spain in 2020, making it possible to assess how the disease has affected different age groups accounting for effects of sex, spatial variation between regions and time trend over the last few years.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Initially, after the model formulation, we utilize the well-known least square approach to estimate the model parameters from the reported COVID-19 cases in Algeria for a selected period of time. We perform the existence and uniqueness of the model solution which are proved via the Picard-Lindelof method.

Using a transmission model, we estimate a basic reproductive number of 3.11 (95% CI, 2.39-4.13), indicating that 58-76% of transmissions must be prevented to stop increasing. We also estimate a case ascertainment rate in Wuhan of 5.0% (95% CI, 3.6-7.4). The true size of the epidemic may be significantly greater than the published case counts suggest, with our model estimating 21 022 (prediction interval, 11 090-33 490) total infections in Wuhan between 1 and 22 January.

As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable human-to-human transmission in England. We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of COVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to inform population sizes and movements, together with parameter estimates from the outbreak in China. We predict that the epidemic will peak 126 to 147 days (approx. 4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in the absence of controls. Assuming biological parameters remain unchanged and transmission persists from February, we expect the peak to occur in June. Starting location and model stochasticity have a minimal impact on peak timing. However, realistic parameter uncertainty leads to peak time estimates ranging from 78 to 241 days following sustained transmission. Seasonal changes in transmission rate can substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic. We provide initial estimates of the epidemic potential of COVID-19. These results can be refined with more precise parameters. Seasonal changes in transmission could shift the timing of the peak into winter, with important implications for healthcare capacity planning.

While new infections are not usually observed directly, they can be estimated from data. However, data may be delayed and potentially biased. We investigated the sensitivity of Rt estimates to different data sources representing COVID-19 in England, and we explored how this sensitivity could track epidemic dynamics in population sub-groups. We sourced public data on test-positive cases, hospital admissions and deaths with confirmed COVID-19 in seven regions of England over March through August 2020. We estimated Rt using a model that mapped unobserved infections to each data source. We then compared differences in Rt with the demographic and social context of surveillance data over time. Our estimates of transmission potential varied for each data source, with the relative inconsistency of estimates varying across regions and over time. Rt estimates based on hospital admissions and deaths were more spatio-temporally synchronous than when compared to estimates from all test positives. We found these differences may be linked to biased representations of subpopulations in each data source. These included spatially clustered testing, and where outbreaks in hospitals, care homes, and young age groups reflected the link between age and severity of the disease. We highlight that policy makers could better target interventions by considering the source populations of Rt estimates. Further work should clarify the best way to combine and interpret Rt estimates from different data sources based on the desired use.

The real-time pandemic monitoring presented here has contributed to the evidence informing this pandemic management throughout the first wave. Estimates on the 10 May showed lockdown had reduced transmission by 75%, the reproduction number falling from 2.6 to 0.61. This regionally varying impact was largest in London with a reduction of 81% (95% credible interval: 77-84%). Reproduction numbers have since then slowly increased, and on 19 June the probability of the epidemic growing was greater than 5% in two regions, South West and London. By this date, an estimated 8% of the population had been infected, with a higher proportion in London (17%). The infection-to-fatality ratio is 1.1% (0.9-1.4%) overall but 17% (14-22%) among the over-75s.

In this paper, a different approach has been discussed, which is the development of predictive models for the SEIRD variables that have been based on the historical data collected, and the context variables to where this model has been applied to. Particularly, the context variables examined in this paper include total population, number of people over 65 years old, poverty index, morbidity rates, average age, and population density. For the construction of the SEIRD predictive models, this study encompasses a deep analysis of the dependence of these variables and also, their relationship with the context variables. Hence, before the development of predictive models using machine learning techniques, a methodology to analyze the interdependence of the SEIRD variables has been proposed. The dependence with the context variables is also discussed; to avoid the curse of dimensionality and multicollinearity problems, leading to better results and the reduction of the computational cost. Finally, several prediction models based on varied machine learning techniques and inputs are considered, these include temporal interdependence, temporal intra-dependence, and dependence with context variables. Each of the predictive models has been studied, as well as their quality of prediction. This paper focuses on the analysis of the quality of this approach, applied in Colombia, obtaining the results about the performance of the predictive models for the SEIRD variables.

However, the application of the conventional back-estimation approach is currently limited due to the methodological challenges and various uncertainties. This study systematically performed meta-analysis for WBE datasets and investigated the use of data-driven models for the COVID-19 community prevalence in lieu of the conventional WBE back-estimation approach. Three different data-driven models, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were applied to the multi-national WBE dataset. To evaluate the robustness of these models, predictions for sixteen scenarios with partial inputs were compared against the actual prevalence reports from clinical testing. The performance of models was further validated using unseen data (data sets not included for establishing the model) from different stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Generally, ANN and ANFIS models showed better accuracy and robustness over MLR models. Air and wastewater temperature played a critical role in the prevalence estimation by data-driven models, especially MLR models. With unseen datasets, ANN model reasonably estimated the prevalence of COVID-19 (cumulative cases) at the initial phase and forecasted the upcoming new cases in 2-4 days at the post-peak phase of the COVID-19 outbreak.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, however, such information has been underestimated. Here, we propose a retrospective methodology to estimate daily infections from daily deaths, because those are usually more accurately documented. Given the incubation period, the time from illness onset to death, and the case fatality ratio, the date of death can be estimated from the date of infection. We apply this idea conversely to estimate infections from deaths. This methodology is applied to Spain and its 19 administrative regions. Our results showed that probable daily infections during the first wave were between 35 and 42 times more than those officially documented on 14 March, when the national government decreed a national lockdown and 9 times more than those documented by the updated version of the official data. The national lockdown had a strong effect on the growth rate of virus transmission, which began to decrease immediately. Finally, the first inferred infection in Spain is about 43 days before the official data were available during the first wave. The current official data show delays of 15-30 days in the first infection relative to the inferred infections in 63% of the regions. In summary, we propose a methodology that allows reinterpretation of official daily infections, improving data accuracy in infection magnitude and dates because it assimilates valuable information from the National Seroprevalence Studies.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34048475,The evaluation of COVID-19 prediction precision with a Lyapunov-like exponent.,,"In the field of machine learning, building models and measuring their performance are two equally important tasks. Currently, measures of precision of regression models' predictions are usually based on the notion of mean error, where by error we mean a deviation of a prediction from an observation. However, these mean based measures of models' performance have two drawbacks. Firstly, they ignore the length of the prediction, which is crucial when dealing with chaotic systems, where a small deviation at the beginning grows exponentially with time. Secondly, these measures are not suitable in situations where a prediction is made for a specific point in time (e.g. a date), since they average all errors from the start of the prediction to its end. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a new measure of models' prediction precision, a divergence exponent, based on the notion of the Lyapunov exponent which overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks. The proposed approach enables the measuring and comparison of models' prediction precision for time series with unequal length and a given target date in the framework of chaotic phenomena. Application of the divergence exponent to the evaluation of models' accuracy is demonstrated by two examples and then a set of selected predictions of COVID-19 spread from other studies is evaluated to show its potential.",Epidemic Forecasting

Unlike other forecasting techniques, our proposed approach first groups the countries having similar demographic and socioeconomic aspects and health sector indicators using K-means clustering algorithm. The cumulative case data of the clustered countries enriched with data related to the lockdown measures are fed to the bidirectional LSTM to train the forecasting model.

They simulate potential scenarios by manipulating model parameters that control processes of disease transmission and recovery. However, the validity of these parameters is challenged by the uncertainty of the impact of public health interventions on disease transmission, and the forecasting accuracy of these models is rarely investigated during an outbreak. We fitted a stochastic transmission model on reported cases, recoveries and deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection across 101 countries. The dynamics of disease transmission was represented in terms of the daily effective reproduction number ([Formula: see text]). The relationship between public health interventions and [Formula: see text] was explored, firstly using a hierarchical clustering algorithm on initial [Formula: see text] patterns, and secondly computing the time-lagged cross correlation among the daily number of policies implemented, [Formula: see text], and daily incidence counts in subsequent months. The impact of updating [Formula: see text] every time a prediction is made on the forecasting accuracy of the model was investigated. We identified 5 groups of countries with distinct transmission patterns during the first 6 months of the pandemic. Early adoption of social distancing measures and a shorter gap between interventions were associated with a reduction on the duration of outbreaks. The lagged correlation analysis revealed that increased policy volume was associated with lower future [Formula: see text] (75 days lag), while a lower [Formula: see text] was associated with lower future policy volume (102 days lag). Lastly, the outbreak prediction accuracy of the model using dynamically updated [Formula: see text] produced an average AUROC of 0.72 (0.708, 0.723) compared to 0.56 (0.555, 0.568) when [Formula: see text] was kept constant. Monitoring the evolution of [Formula: see text] during an epidemic is an important complementary piece of information to reported daily counts, recoveries and deaths, since it provides an early signal of the efficacy of containment measures. Using updated [Formula: see text] values produces significantly better predictions of future outbreaks.

The extent to which these interventions are successful in stopping the spread have not been characterized in countries with distinct socioeconomic groups. We compared the effects of a partial lockdown on disease transmission among Kuwaitis (P1) and non-Kuwaitis (P2) living in Kuwait. METHODS: We fit a modified metapopulation SEIR transmission model to reported cases stratified by two groups to estimate the impact of a partial lockdown on the effective reproduction number ([Formula: see text]). We estimated the basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) for the transmission in each group and simulated the potential trajectories of an outbreak from the first recorded case of community transmission until 12 days after the partial lockdown. We estimated [Formula: see text] values of both groups before and after the partial curfew, simulated the effect of these values on the epidemic curves and explored a range of cross-transmission scenarios. RESULTS: We estimate [Formula: see text] at 1.08 (95% CI: 1.00-1.26) for P1 and 2.36 (2.03-2.71) for P2. On March 22nd, [Formula: see text] for P1 and P2 are estimated at 1.19 (1.04-1.34) and 1.75 (1.26-2.11) respectively. After the partial curfew had taken effect, [Formula: see text] for P1 dropped modestly to 1.05 (0.82-1.26) but almost doubled for P2 to 2.89 (2.30-3.70). Our simulated epidemic trajectories show that the partial curfew measure greatly reduced and delayed the height of the peak in P1, yet significantly elevated and hastened the peak in P2. Modest cross-transmission between P1 and P2 greatly elevated the height of the peak in P1 and brought it forward in time closer to the peak of P2. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate and quantify how the same lockdown intervention can accentuate disease transmission in some subpopulations while potentially controlling it in others. Any such control may further become compromised in the presence of cross-transmission between subpopulations. Future interventions and policies need to be sensitive to socioeconomic and health disparities.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Here we provide the reproduction number estimation both in space and in time from February 24 to April 24, 2020 over 2 months into the epidemic. Methods: The aim of the present work was to provide a systematical mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics spread to all regions of Italy. To do so, we estimated the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), by using the maximum likelihood estimation method in the early stage of the epidemic. In addition, we determined time evolution of this parameter across the 2 months of the observational period. Finally, we linked R t , with two indices, the first representing the number of contagious people and the latter the density of susceptibiltiy to infection of people in a region as recorded on April 24, 2020. Results: Our estimates suggest a basic reproduction number averaged over all the regions of 3.29. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics reported here, we gave a quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of the government measures to lower the reproduction number below 1 (control regime). We estimated that the worst-hit regions in Italy reached the control regime level (R t < 1) in about a month. Conclusion: Our work was carried out in the period between April and July,2020. We found that the mean value of time to reach the control regime across the whole country was about 31 days from February 24, 2020.

The effective reproduction numbers (R) for the increasing phase, the transition phase and the state-of-emergency phase in the first wave of the disease were estimated as 1.78 (95% credible interval (CrI): 1.73-1.82), 0.74 (95% CrI: 0.71-0.78) and 0.63 (95% CrI: 0.61-0.65), respectively, in Tokyo and as 1.58 (95% CrI: 1.51-1.64), 1.20 (95% CrI: 1.15-1.25) and 0.48 (95% CrI: 0.44-0.51), respectively, in Osaka. Projections showed that a 50% decrease in the high-risk transmission is required to keep R less than 1 in both locations-a level necessary to maintain control of the epidemic and minimize the risk of resurgence.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

The basic reproduction number (R0) is either ratio or rate or the basic reproductive rate. This dimensionless number was calculated in the past to describe the contagiousness or transmissibility of infectious agents for many communicable diseases. Its importance in the context of COVID-19 is not less, it tells us about the public health measures to be undertaken for disease prevention, and how the transmission of COVID-19 will be affected or eliminated. R0 is affected by several biological, sociobehavioral, and environmental factors which decide agent transmission. R0 is estimated by using complex mathematical models, the results of which are easily distorted, misjudged, and misused. R0 is not a biological constant for an agent or pathogen, it is a rate over time. It can measure the disease severity and also gives an estimate about the herd immunity required for the reversal of epidemic. R0 cannot be altered through vaccination campaigns though it can tell us about the relationship between the population's immune status and epidemic curve. Modeled R0 values are dependent on the model structures and assumptions made. Some R0 values reported in the scientific literature are likely outdated as assumptions are frequently changing in the current pandemic. R0 must be predicted and applied with great caution as this basic metric is far from simple.",Epidemic Forecasting
34035086,Predicting the propagation of COVID-19 at an international scale: extension of an SIR model.,covid-19;epidemiology;public health;statistics & research methods,"OBJECTIVES: Several epidemiological models have been published to forecast the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet many of them have proven inaccurate for reasons that remain to be fully determined. We aimed to develop a novel model and implement it in a freely accessible web application. DESIGN: We built an SIR-type compartmental model with two additional compartments: D (deceased patients); L (individuals who will die but who will not infect anybody due to social or medical isolation) and integration of a time-dependent transmission rate and a periodical weekly component linked to the way in which cases and deaths are reported. RESULTS: The model was implemented in a web application (as of 2 June 2020). It was shown to be able to accurately capture the changes in the dynamics of the pandemic for 20 countries whatever the type of pandemic spread or containment measures: for instance, the model explains 97% of the variance of US data (daily cases) and predicts the number of deaths at a 2-week horizon with an error of 1%. CONCLUSIONS: In early performance evaluation, our model showed a high level of accuracy between prediction and observed data. Such a tool might be used by the global community to follow the spread of the pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

This study analyzes the complete outbreak data from Wuhan, assesses the impact of these public health interventions, and estimates the asymptomatic, undetected and total cases for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. METHODS: By taking different stages of the outbreak into account, we developed a time-dependent compartmental model to describe the dynamics of disease transmission and case detection and reporting. Model coefficients were parameterized by using the reported cases and following key events and escalated control strategies. Then the model was used to calibrate the complete outbreak data by using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method. Finally we used the model to estimate asymptomatic and undetected cases and approximate the overall antibody prevalence level. RESULTS: We found that the transmission rate between Jan 24 and Feb 1, 2020, was twice as large as that before the lockdown on Jan 23 and 67.6% (95% CI [0.584,0.759]) of detectable infections occurred during this period. Based on the reported estimates that around 20% of infections were asymptomatic and their transmission ability was about 70% of symptomatic ones, we estimated that there were about 14,448 asymptomatic and undetected cases (95% CI [12,364,23,254]), which yields an estimate of a total of 64,454 infected cases (95% CI [62,370,73,260]), and the overall antibody prevalence level in the population of Wuhan was 0.745% (95% CI [0.693%,0.814%]) by March 31, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan was achieved via the enforcement of a combination of multiple NPIs: the lockdown on Jan 23, the stay-at-home order on Feb 2, the massive isolation of all symptomatic individuals via newly constructed special shelter hospitals on Feb 6, and the large scale screening process on Feb 18. Our results indicate that the population in Wuhan is far away from establishing herd immunity and provide insights for other affected countries and regions in designing control strategies and planing vaccination programs.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

We formulate a transmission dynamical model where it is assumed that some portion of the people generates the infections, which is affected by the quarantine and latent time. We study the effect of various parameters of corona virus through the fractional mathematical model. The Laguerre collocation technique is used to deal with the concerned mathematical model numerically. In order to deal with the dynamics of the novel corona virus we collect the experimental data from 15th-21st April, 2020 of Maharashtra state, India.

This kind of analysis has become an important part of information epidemiology. We have analyzed the use of the keywords ""Coronavirus epidemic,"" ""N95 mask,"" and ""Wuhan epidemic"" to judge whether the introduction of real-time search data has improved the efficiency of the Coronavirus epidemic prediction model.

COVID-19 is a new disease that is highly infectious and dangerous. It has deeply shaken the world, claiming the lives of over a million people and bringing the world to a lockdown. So, the early detection of COVID is essential for the patients' timely treatment and preventive measures. A filtering technique with time-varying parameters is presented to predict the stochastic volatility (SV) of COVID-19 cases. The time-varying parameters are estimated using the Kalman filtering technique based on the stochastic component of data volatility. Kalman filtering is essential as it removes insignificant information from the data. We forecast one-step-ahead predicted volatility with +/- 3 standard prediction errors, which is implemented by Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We conclude that Kalman filtering in conjunction with the SV model is a reliable predictive model for COVID-19 since it is less constrained by the past autoregressive information.",Diagnosis;Epidemic Forecasting

In this paper, we employ an SEIR-based compartmental model to study and analyze the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in Nigeria. The model incorporates different group of populations (that is, high- and- moderate risk populations) and is use to investigate the influence on each population on the overall transmission dynamics.The model, which is fitted well to the data, is qualitatively analyzed to evaluate the impacts of different schemes for controlstrategies. Mathematical analysis reveals that the model has two equilibria; i.e., disease-free equilibrium (DFE) which is local asymptotic stability (LAS) if the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) is less than 1; and unstable for R 0 > 1 , and an endemic equilibrium (EE) which is globally asymptotic stability (LAS) whenever R 0 > 1 . Furthermore, we find that the model undergoes a phenomenon of backward bifurcation (BB, a coexistence of stable DFE and stable EE even if the R 0 < 1 ). We employ Partial Rank Correlation coefficients (PRCCs) for sensitivity analyses to evaluate the model's parameters. Our results highlight that proper surveillance, especially movement of individuals from high risk to moderate risk population, testing, as well as imposition of other NPIs measures are vital strategies for mitigating the COVID-19 epidemic in Nigeria. Besides, in the absence of an exact solution for the proposed model, we solve the model with the well-known ODE45 numerical solver and the effective numerical schemes such as Euler (EM), Runge-Kutta of order 2 (RK-2), and Runge-Kutta of order 4 (RK-4) in order to establish approximate solutions and to show the physical features of the model.

Climates vary in Brazil due to the territorial extension of the country, its relief, geography, and other factors. Since the most common COVID-19 symptoms are related to the respiratory system, many researchers have studied the correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases with meteorological variables like temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc. Also, due to its high transmission rate, some researchers have analyzed the impact of human mobility on the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission. There is a dearth of literature that considers these two variables when predicting the spread of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we analyzed the correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases and human mobility, and meteorological data in Brazilian capitals. We found that the correlation between such variables depends on the regions where the cities are located. We employed the variables with a significant correlation with COVID-19 cases to predict the number of COVID-19 infections in all Brazilian capitals and proposed a prediction method combining the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Exogenous inputs (ARIMAX) method, which we called EEMD-ARIMAX. After analyzing the results poor predictions were further investigated using a signal processing-based anomaly detection method. Computational tests showed that EEMD-ARIMAX achieved a forecast 26.73% better than ARIMAX. Moreover, an improvement of 30.69% in the average root mean squared error (RMSE) was noticed when applying the EEMD-ARIMAX method to the data normalized after the anomaly detection.",Epidemic Forecasting

Classical compartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the effects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease. The importance of social structure, such as the age dependence that proved essential in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, must be considered, and in addition, the available data are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of uncertainty must be incorporated into the model from the beginning. In this work we address these aspects, through an optimal control formulation of a socially structured epidemic model in presence of uncertain data. After the introduction of the optimal control problem, we formulate an instantaneous approximation of the control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled compartmental models capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction. The need for long-term interventions shows that alternative actions based on the social structure of the system can be as effective as the more expensive global strategy. The timing and intensity of interventions, however, is particularly relevant in the case of uncertain parameters on the actual number of infected people. Simulations related to data from the first wave of the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Italy are presented and discussed.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We introduce a novel risk-stratified SIR-HCD model that introduces new variables to model the dynamics of low-contact (e.g., work from home) and high-contact (e.g., work on-site) subpopulations while sharing parameters to control their respective R0(t) over time. We test our model on data of daily reported hospitalizations and cumulative mortality of COVID-19 in Harris County, Texas, from May 1, 2020, until October 4, 2020, collected from multiple sources (USA FACTS, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Southeast Texas Regional Advisory Council COVID-19 report, TMC daily news, and Johns Hopkins University county-level mortality reporting). RESULTS: We evaluated our model's forecasting accuracy in Harris County, TX (the most populated county in the Greater Houston area) during Phase-I and Phase-II reopening. Not only does our model outperform other competing models, but it also supports counterfactual analysis to simulate the impact of future policies in a local setting, which is unique among existing approaches. DISCUSSION: Mortality and hospitalization rates are significantly impacted by local quarantine and reopening policies. Existing models do not directly account for the effect of these policies on infection, hospitalization, and death rates in an explicit and explainable manner. Our work is an attempt to improve prediction of these trends by incorporating this information into the model, thus supporting decision-making. CONCLUSION: Our work is a timely effort to attempt to model the dynamics of pandemics under the influence of local policies.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
34019581,Evaluating data-driven methods for short-term forecasts of cumulative SARS-CoV2 cases.,,"BACKGROUND: The WHO announced the epidemic of SARS-CoV2 as a public health emergency of international concern on 30th January 2020. To date, it has spread to more than 200 countries and has been declared a global pandemic. For appropriate preparedness, containment, and mitigation response, the stakeholders and policymakers require prior guidance on the propagation of SARS-CoV2. METHODOLOGY: This study aims to provide such guidance by forecasting the cumulative COVID-19 cases up to 4 weeks ahead for 187 countries, using four data-driven methodologies; autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing model (ETS), and random walk forecasts (RWF) with and without drift. For these forecasts, we evaluate the accuracy and systematic errors using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), respectively. FINDINGS: The results show that the ARIMA and ETS methods outperform the other two forecasting methods. Additionally, using these forecasts, we generate heat maps to provide a pictorial representation of the countries at risk of having an increase in the cases in the coming 4 weeks of February 2021. CONCLUSION: Due to limited data availability during the ongoing pandemic, less data-hungry short-term forecasting models, like ARIMA and ETS, can help in anticipating the future outbreaks of SARS-CoV2.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

OBJECTIVE: We present a new agent-based model (ABM) called the Discrete-Event, Simulated Social Agent based Network Transmission model (DESSABNeT) and demonstrate its ability to model the spread of COVID-19 in large cities like Sydney, Melbourne and Gold Coast. Our aim was to validate the model with its disease dynamics and underlying social network. DESIGN: DESSABNeT relies on disease transmission within simulated social networks. It employs an epidemiological SEIRD+M (Susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, died and managed) structure. One hundred simulations were run for each city, with simulated social restrictions closely modelling real restrictions imposed in each location. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): The mean predicted daily incidence of COVID-19 cases were compared to real case incidence data for each city. Reff and health service utilisation outputs were compared to the literature, or for the Gold Coast with daily incidence of hospitalisation. RESULTS: DESSABNeT modelled multiple physical distancing restrictions and predicted epidemiological outcomes of Sydney, Melbourne and the Gold Coast, validating this model for future simulation work. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: DESSABNeT is a valid platform to model the spread of COVID-19 in large cities in Australia and potentially internationally. The platform is suitable to model different combinations of social restrictions, or to model contact tracing, predict, and plan for, the impact on hospital and ICU admissions, and deaths; and also the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and optimal social restrictions during vaccination.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

The absence of immunity, presymptomatic transmission, and the relatively high level of virulence of the COVID-19 infection led to a massive flow of patients in intensive care units (ICU). This unprecedented situation calls for rapid and accurate mathematical models to best inform public health policies. We develop an original parsimonious discrete-time model that accounts for the effect of the age of infection on the natural history of the disease. Analysing the ongoing COVID-19 in France as a test case, through the publicly available time series of nationwide hospital mortality and ICU activity, we estimate the value of the key epidemiological parameters and the impact of lock-down implementation delay. This work shows that including memory-effects in the modelling of COVID-19 spreading greatly improves the accuracy of the fit to the epidemiological data. We estimate that the epidemic wave in France started on Jan 20 [Jan 12, Jan 28] (95% likelihood interval) with a reproduction number initially equal to 2.99 [2.59, 3.39], which was reduced by the national lock-down started on Mar 17 to 24 [21, 27] of its value. We also estimate that the implementation of the latter a week earlier or later would have lead to a difference of about respectively -13k and +50k hospital deaths by the end of lock-down. The present parsimonious discrete-time framework constitutes a useful tool for now- and forecasting simultaneously community incidence and ICU capacity strain.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Methods: We developed a simple likelihood-based framework to estimate the instantaneous asymptomatic proportion of infectious diseases. Taking the COVID-19 epidemics in Hong Kong as a case study, we applied the estimation framework to estimate the reported asymptomatic proportion (rAP) using the publicly available surveillance data. We divided the time series of daily cases into four stages of epidemics in Hong Kong by examining the persistency of the epidemic and compared the rAPs of imported cases and local cases at different stages. Results: As of July 31, 2020, there were two intermittent epidemics in Hong Kong. The first one was dominated by imported cases, accounting for 63.2% of the total cases, and the second one was dominated by local cases, accounting for 86.5% of the total cases. The rAP was estimated at 23.1% (95% CI: 10.8-39.7%) from January 23 to July 31, and the rAPs were estimated at 22.6% (95% CI: 11.1-38.9%) among local cases and 38.7% (95% CI: 9.0-72.0%) among imported cases. Our results showed that the rAPs of local cases were not significantly different between the two epidemics, but increased gradually during the first epidemic period. In contrast, the rAPs of imported cases in the latter epidemic period were significantly higher than that in the previous epidemic period. Conclusion: Hong Kong has a high rAP of imported COVID-19 cases and should continue to strengthen the detection and isolation of imported individuals to prevent the resurgence of the disease.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In this paper, we investigated the characteristics of the trend of daily count of COVID-19 deaths in Ghana using zero-inflated models. We envisaged that the trend of COVID-19 deaths per day in Ghana portrays a general increase from the onset of the pandemic in the country to about day 160 after which there is a general decrease onward. We fitted a zero-inflated Poisson autoregressive model and zero-inflated negative binomial autoregressive model to the data in the partial-likelihood framework. The zero-inflated negative binomial autoregressive model outperformed the zero-inflated Poisson autoregressive model. On the other hand, the dynamic zero-inflated Poisson autoregressive model performed better than the dynamic negative binomial autoregressive model. The predicted new death based on the zero-inflated negative binomial autoregressive model indicated that Ghana's COVID-19 death per day will rise sharply few days after 30(th) November 2020 and drastically fall just as in the observed data.",Epidemic Forecasting

The so-called 'exponential growth bias' is of new relevance in the context of COVID-19, because it explains why humans have fundamental difficulties to grasp the magnitude of a spreading epidemic. Here, we addressed the question, whether logarithmic scaling and contextual framing of epidemiological data affect the anticipation of exponential growth. Our findings show that underestimations were most pronounced when growth curves were linearly scaled and framed in the context of a more advanced epidemic progression. For logarithmic scaling, estimates were much more accurate, on target for growth rates around 31%, and not affected by contextual framing. We conclude that the logarithmic depiction is conducive for detecting exponential growth during an early phase as well as resurgences of exponential growth.",Epidemic Forecasting

We have made the predictions with reasonable assumptions based on real data, considering that the precise course of an epidemic is highly dependent on how and when quarantine, isolation, and precautionary measures were imposed. The proposed method gives better approximation values of new cases, R0 (Reproductive Number), daily deaths, daily infectious, transmission rate, and recovered individuals.Through the analysis of the reported results, the proposed SIRD model can be an effective method for investigating the effect of government interventions on COVID-19 associated transmission and mortality rate at the time of epidemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Some models that account for the deceased, quarantined or social distancing functions were also presented. However, in any local space the real data reveals that the effects of lock-down and traveling are significant in decreasing and increasing the impact of this virus respectively. Here, discrete and continuum models for the dynamics of this virus are suggested. The continuum dynamical model is studied in detail. The present model deals with exposed, infected, recovered and deceased individuals (EIRD), which accounts for the health isolation and travelers (HIT) effects. Up to now no exact solutions of the parametric-dependent, nonlinear dynamical system NLDS were found. In this work, our objective is to find the exact solutions of a NLDS. To this issue, a novel approach is presented where a NLDS is recast to a linear dynamical system LDS. This is done by implementing the unified method (UM), with auxiliary equations, which are taken coupled linear ODE's (LDS). Numerical results of the exact solutions are evaluated, which can be applied to data in a local space (or anywhere) when the initial data for the IRD are known. Here, as an example, initial conditions for the components in the model equation of COVID-19, are taken from the real data in Egypt. The results of susceptible, infected, recovered and deceased people are computed. The comparison between the computed results and the real data shows an agreement up to a relative error 1 0 - 3 . On the other hand it is remarked that locking-down plays a dominant role in decreasing the number of infected people. The equilibrium states are determined and it is found that they are stable. This reveals a relevant result that the COVID-19 can be endemic in the case of a disturbance in the number of the exposed people. A disturbance in the form of an increase in the exposed number, leads to an increase in the number of infected people. This result is, globally, valid. Furthermore, initial states control is analyzed, where region of initial conditions for infected and exposed is determined. We developed a software tool to interact with the model and facilitate applying various data of different local spaces.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

This study aimed to determine the ongoing trend and upcoming infection status of COVID-19 in county levels of Texas. METHODS: Data were extracted from the following sources: published literature, surveillance, unpublished reports, and websites of Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), Natality report of Texas, and WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard. The 4-compartment Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removal (SEIR) mathematical model was used to estimate the current trend and future prediction of basic reproduction number and infection cases in Texas. Because the basic reproduction number is not sufficient to predict the outbreak, we applied the Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model to calculate the probability of the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: The estimated mean basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Texas is predicted to be 2.65 by January 31, 2021. Our model indicated that the third wave might occur at the beginning of May 2021, which will peak at the end of June 2021. This prediction may come true if the current spreading situation/level persists, i.e., no clinically effective vaccine is available, or this vaccination program fails for some reason in this area.

The COVID- 19 taskforce within the Ghent University hospital made use of ten-day forecasts on the required number of beds for COVID- 19 patients across different wards. METHODS: The planning tool combined a Poisson model for the number of newly admitted patients on each day with a multistate model for the transitions of admitted patients to the different wards, discharge or death. These models were used to simulate the required capacity of beds by ward type over the next 10 days, along with worst-case and best-case bounds. RESULTS: Overall, the models resulted in good predictions of the required number of beds across different hospital wards. Short-term predictions were especially accurate as these are less sensitive to sudden changes in number of beds on a given ward (e.g. due to referrals).

34006031,Modelling COVID-19 transmission in Africa: countrywise projections of total and severe infections under different lockdown scenarios.,epidemiology;public health;respiratory infections,"OBJECTIVES: As of 13 January 2021, there have been 3 113 963 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 and 74 619 deaths across the African continent. Despite relatively lower numbers of cases initially, many African countries are now experiencing an exponential increase in case numbers. Estimates of the progression of disease and potential impact of different interventions are needed to inform policymaking decisions. Herein, we model the possible trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in 52 African countries under different intervention scenarios. DESIGN: We developed a compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to estimate the COVID-19 case burden for all African countries while considering four scenarios: no intervention, moderate lockdown, hard lockdown and hard lockdown with continued restrictions once lockdown is lifted. We further analysed the potential impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations affected by HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB). RESULTS: In the absence of an intervention, the most populous countries had the highest peaks in active projected number of infections with Nigeria having an estimated 645 081 severe infections. The scenario with a hard lockdown and continued post-lockdown interventions to reduce transmission was the most efficacious strategy for delaying the time to the peak and reducing the number of cases. In South Africa, projected peak severe infections increase from 162 977 to 2 03 261, when vulnerable populations with HIV/AIDS and TB are included in the analysis. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading across the African continent. Estimates of the potential impact of interventions and burden of disease are essential for policymakers to make evidence-based decisions on the distribution of limited resources and to balance the economic costs of interventions with the potential for saving lives.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

With the overwhelming burden imposed by COVID-19 on the health care system, an emergent need exists to accurately forecast hospitalization needs within an actionable timeframe. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to leverage an existing COVID-19 case and death forecasting tool to generate the expected number of concurrent hospitalizations, occupied intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and in-use ventilators 1 day to 4 weeks in the future for New Mexico and each of its five health regions. METHODS: We developed a probabilistic model that took as input the number of new COVID-19 cases for New Mexico from Los Alamos National Laboratory's COVID-19 Forecasts Using Fast Evaluations and Estimation tool, and we used the model to estimate the number of new daily hospital admissions 4 weeks into the future based on current statewide hospitalization rates. The model estimated the number of new admissions that would require an ICU bed or use of a ventilator and then projected the individual lengths of hospital stays based on the resource need. By tracking the lengths of stay through time, we captured the projected simultaneous need for inpatient beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. We used a postprocessing method to adjust the forecasts based on the differences between prior forecasts and the subsequent observed data. Thus, we ensured that our forecasts could reflect a dynamically changing situation on the ground. RESULTS: Forecasts made between September 1 and December 9, 2020, showed variable accuracy across time, health care resource needs, and forecast horizon. Forecasts made in October, when new COVID-19 cases were steadily increasing, had an average accuracy error of 20.0%, while the error in forecasts made in September, a month with low COVID-19 activity, was 39.7%. Across health care use categories, state-level forecasts were more accurate than those at the regional level. Although the accuracy declined as the forecast was projected further into the future, the stated uncertainty of the prediction improved. Forecasts were within 5% of their stated uncertainty at the 50% and 90% prediction intervals at the 3- to 4-week forecast horizon for state-level inpatient and ICU needs. However, uncertainty intervals were too narrow for forecasts of state-level ventilator need and all regional health care resource needs. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time forecasting of the burden imposed by a spreading infectious disease is a crucial component of decision support during a public health emergency. Our proposed methodology demonstrated utility in providing near-term forecasts, particularly at the state level. This tool can aid other stakeholders as they face COVID-19 population impacts now and in the future.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The COVID-19 pandemic originated from a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that was formerly identified in 2003. The contagiousness, dynamics of the pathogen, and mobility of the general population incurred the occurrence of underestimation of infection (i.e., the unidentified cases and the gap with the identified cases) that was potentially substantial in magnitude, which was supposed to connect with subsequent cyclical outbreaks in practice. We employed a Susceptible-Infected-Removed-Contained (SIR-C) mathematical model to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with COVID-19, then asymptotically simulated the peak sizes and peak dates of the identified and unidentified cases, the underestimation, and the dynamics of the gap. The simulation outcomes indicated that unidentified peak dates in practice could predate the reported peak dates for a variable period of weeks or months. In comparison, the saturation sizes of infection remained at commensurate levels. The curve of the initial exponential-like outbreak for the undocumented cases would flatten when the gap between concurrent identified cases and unidentified cases decreased. The rate of non-pharmaceutical containment could impact the trend of disease transmission ceteris paribus, and the greater the rate the larger reduction of infections. When the rate reached a certain level of threshold, the undocumented curve would shift from flattening effect to decaying effect. A similar trend was observed when it applied to the rate of pharmaceutical containment measures ceteris paribus. The results were sensitive to the duration of infection (DOI), it manifested that greater values of DOI were associated with greater peak sizes and greater peak dates for both documented and undocumented cases. Conditional on assumptions, calibration of DOI from 8 days to 18 days would increase the unidentified peak size by nearly 56% and the peak date by almost 18 days.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

It allows randomness to the infectivity of individuals rather than a constant reproduction number as assumed by standard models. Key epidemiological quantities, such as the distribution of final epidemic size and expected epidemic duration, are derived and estimated based on real data for various regions and countries. The associated time lag of the effect of intervention in each country or region is estimated. Our results are consistent with the incubation time of COVID-19 found by recent medical study. We demonstrate that our model could potentially be a valuable tool in the modeling of COVID-19. More importantly, the proposed model of 2P-DCP could also be used as an important tool in epidemiological modelling as this type of contagion models with very simple structures is adequate to describe the evolution of regional epidemic and worldwide pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

To predict the possible number of cases within the susceptible population under four social distancing scenarios, the COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics (CHIME) was used. With increasing social distancing, the epidemiological curve flattened, and its peak shifted to the right. The observed or actually reported number of cases was above the projected number of cases at the onset; however, subsequently, it fell below all predicted trends.

Modelling results obtained from analytical tool development are essential to understand the ongoing pandemic dynamics with a view to helping the public and policy makers. The pandemic has generated data on a huge number of interesting statistics such as the number of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths in many spatio-temporal resolutions for the analysts to investigate. The multivariate nature of these data sets, along with the inherent spatio-temporal dependencies, poses new challenges for modellers. This article proposes a two-stage hierarchical Bayesian model as a joint bivariate model for the number of cases and deaths observed weekly for the different local authority administrative regions in England. An adaptive model is proposed for the weekly Covid-19 death rates as part of the joint bivariate model. The adaptive model is able to detect possible step changes in death rates in neighbouring areas. The joint model is also used to evaluate the effects of several socio-economic and environmental covariates on the rates of cases and deaths. Inclusion of these covariates points to the presence of a north-south divide in both the case and death rates. Nitrogen dioxide, the only air pollution measure used in the model, is seen to be significantly positively associated with the number cases, even in the presence of the spatio-temporal random effects taking care of spatio-temporal dependencies present in the data. The proposed models provide excellent fits to the observed data and are seen to perform well for predicting the location specific number of deaths a week in advance. The structure of the models is very general and the same framework can be used for modelling other areally aggregated temporal statistics of the pandemics, e.g. the rate of hospitalisation.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In just over two months, the unprecedented rapid spread resulted in more than 10,000 confirmed cases worldwide. This study predicted the infectious spread of coronavirus disease in the contiguous United States using a convolutional autoencoder with long short-term memory and compared its predictive performance with that of the convolutional autoencoder without long short-term memory. The epidemic data were obtained from the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from January 1st to April 6th, 2020. We used data from the first 366,607 confirmed cases in the United States. In this study, the data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were gridded by latitude and longitude and the grids were categorized into six epidemic levels based on the number of confirmed cases. The input of the convolutional autoencoder with long short-term memory was the distribution of confirmed cases 14 days before, whereas the output was the distribution of confirmed cases 7 days after the date of testing. The mean square error in this model was 1.664, the peak signal-to-noise ratio was 55.699, and the structural similarity index was 0.99, which were better than those of the corresponding results of the convolutional autoencoder. These results showed that the convolutional autoencoder with long short-term memory effectively and reliably predicted the spread of infectious disease in the contiguous United States.",Epidemic Forecasting

From the preliminary descriptive analysis, it shows that environmental factor such as UV (ultraviolet) is one of the essential factors that should be considered to observe the COVID-19 epidemic drivers. Moreover, there are education, government, morphological, health, economic, and behavioral factors contributing to the growth of COVID-19. Besides descriptive analysis, in this research, multivariate analysis is considered to provide comprehensive explanations about factors contributing to pandemic dynamics. To achieve rich explanations, visual attribution of explainable Convolution-LSTM is utilized to see high contributing factors responsible for the growth of daily COVID-19 cases. Our model consists of 1 D CNN in the first layer to capture local relationships among variables followed by LSTM layers to capture local dependencies over time. It produces the lowest prediction errors compared to the other existing models. This permits us to employ gradient-based visual attribution for generating saliency maps for each time dimension and variable. These are then used for explaining which variables throughout which period of the interval is contributing for a given time-series prediction, likewise as explaining that during that time intervals were the joint contribution of most vital variables for that prediction.

Our analysis reveals that the time-dependent probability density function exists if the basic reproduction number is greater than one. It converges to the Dirac delta function on the long run (entirely concentrated on zero) as the basic reproduction number tends to one from above. The result is applied using published COVID-19 parameters and also applied to analyze the probability distribution of the aggregate number of COVID-19 cases in the United States for the period: January 22, 2020-March 23, 2021.

The model used serial interval with a gamma distribution and applied 'early R' to estimate the R0 and 'projections' package in R program. This was performed to mimic the probable cumulative epidemic trajectories and predict future daily incidence by fitting the data to existing daily incidence and the estimated R0 by a model based on the assumption that daily incidence follows Poisson distribution. The maximum-likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.242 for COVID-19 outbreak, as on June 2020. The median with 95% CI of R0 values was 2.242 (1.50-3.00) estimated by bootstrap resampling method. The expected number of new cases for the next 60 days would progressively increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 27,238 (26,008-28,467) at the end of 60th day in the future. But, if R0 value was doubled the estimated total number of cumulative cases would increase up to 432,411 (400,929-463,893) and if, R0 increase by 50%, the cases would increase up to 86,386 (80,910-91,861).

Here, we introduce the epidemicity index e0, a threshold-type indicator: if e0 > 0, initial foci may cause infection peaks even if [Formula: see text]. Therefore, effective containment measures should achieve a negative epidemicity index. We use spatially explicit models to rank containment measures for projected evolutions of the ongoing pandemic in Italy.

DESIGN: Population-level aggregate analysis. SETTING: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia. METHODS: We applied an extended time-dependent SEICRD compartmental model to predict the flow of people between six states, susceptible-exposed-infected-critical-recovery-death, accounting for community mitigation strategies and the latent period between exposure and infected and contagious states. Then, we used the WHO Adaptt Surge Planning Tool to predict intensive care unit (ICU) and human resources capacity based on predicted daily active and cumulative infections from the SEICRD model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predicted COVID-19 infections, deaths, and ICU and human resources capacity for disease management. RESULTS: COVID-19 infections vary daily from 498 per million in Bahrain to over 300 per million in UAE and Qatar, to 9 per million in Saudi Arabia. The cumulative number of deaths varies from 302 per million in Oman to 89 in Qatar. UAE attained its first peak as early as 21 April 2020, whereas Oman had its peak on 29 August 2020. In absolute terms, Saudi Arabia is predicted to have the highest COVID-19 mortality burden, followed by UAE and Oman. The predicted maximum number of COVID-19-infected patients in need of oxygen therapy during the peak of emergency admissions varies between 690 in Bahrain, 1440 in Oman and over 10 000 in Saudi Arabia.

Two fundamental parameters, the basic reproduction number (R 0) and case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19, help in this understanding process. The objective of this study was to estimate the R 0 and CFR of COVID-19 and assess whether the parameters vary in different regions of the world. Methods: We carried out a systematic review to find the reported estimates of the R 0 and the CFR in articles from international databases between January 1 and August 31, 2020. Random-effect models and Forest plots were implemented to evaluate the mean effect size of R 0 and the CFR. Furthermore, R 0 and CFR of the studies were quantified based on geographic location, the tests/thousand population, and the median population age of the countries where the studies were conducted. To assess statistical heterogeneity among the selected articles, the I (2) statistic and the Cochran's Q test were used. Results: Forty-five studies involving R 0 and 34 studies involving CFR were included. The pooled estimation of R 0 was 2.69 (95% CI: 2.40, 2.98), and that of the CFR was 2.67 (2.25, 3.13). The CFR in different regions of the world varied significantly, from 2.49 (2.08, 2.94) in Asia to 3.40 (2.81, 4.04) in North America. We observed higher mean CFR values for the countries with lower tests (3.15 vs 2.16) and greater median population age (3.13 vs 2.27). However, R 0 did not vary significantly in different regions of the world. Conclusions: An R 0 of 2.69 and a CFR of 2.67 indicate the severity of the COVID-19.

During this period, forecasting is of utmost priority for health care planning and to combat COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we proposed and extended classical SEIR compartment model refined by contact tracing and hospitalization strategies to explain the COVID-19 outbreak. We calibrated our model with daily COVID-19 data for the five provinces of India namely, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal and the overall India. To identify the most effective parameters we conduct a sensitivity analysis by using the partial rank correlation coefficients techniques. The value of those sensitive parameters were estimated from the observed data by least square method. We performed sensitivity analysis for R 0 to investigate the relative importance of the system parameters. Also, we computed the sensitivity indices for R 0 to determine the robustness of the model predictions to parameter values. Our study demonstrates that a critically important strategy can be achieved by reducing the disease transmission coefficient beta s and clinical outbreak rate q a to control the COVID-19 outbreaks. Performed short-term predictions for the daily and cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 outbreak for all the five provinces of India and the overall India exhibited the steady exponential growth of some states and other states showing decays of daily new cases. Long-term predictions for the Republic of India reveals that the COVID-19 cases will exhibit oscillatory dynamics.

Two fundamental parameters drive the dynamics: the time elapsed between contagious and isolation of infected individuals ([Formula: see text]) and the ratio of people isolated over the total infected ones (p). The evolution is more sensitive to the [Formula: see text]parameter. The model not only reproduces the real data but also predicts the second wave before the former vanishes.

We screen n = 386 public COVID-19 forecasting models, identifying n = 7 that are global in scope and provide public, date-versioned forecasts. We examine their predictive performance for mortality by weeks of extrapolation, world region, and estimation month. We additionally assess prediction of the timing of peak daily mortality. Globally, models released in October show a median absolute percent error (MAPE) of 7 to 13% at six weeks, reflecting surprisingly good performance despite the complexities of modelling human behavioural responses and government interventions. Median absolute error for peak timing increased from 8 days at one week of forecasting to 29 days at eight weeks and is similar for first and subsequent peaks. The framework and public codebase ( https://github.com/pyliu47/covidcompare ) can be used to compare predictions and evaluate predictive performance going forward.",Epidemic Forecasting
33971608,On forecasting the community-level COVID-19 cases from the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater.,covid-19;community wastewater surveillance;forecasting;sars-cov-2,"The building of an effective wastewater-based epidemiological model that can translate SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater to the prevalence of virus shedders within a community is a significant challenge for wastewater surveillance. The objectives of this study were to investigate the association between SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations and the COVID-19 cases at the community-level and to assess how SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations should be integrated into a wastewater-based epidemiological statistical model that can provide reliable forecasts for the number of COVID-19 infections and the evolution over time as well. Weekly variations on the SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations and COVID-19 cases from April 29, 2020 through February 17, 2021 were obtained in Borough of Indiana, PA. Vector autoregression (VAR) model with different data forms were fitted on this data from April 29, 2020 through January 27, 2021, and the performance in three weeks ahead forecasting (February 3, 10, and 17) were compared with measures of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). A stationary block bootstrapping VAR method was also presented to reduce the variability in the forecasting values. Our results demonstrate that VAR(1) estimated with the logged data has the best interpretation of the data, but a VAR(1) estimated with the original data has a stronger forecasting ability. The forecast accuracy, measured by MAPE, for 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks in the future can be as low as 11.85%, 8.97% and 21.57%. The forecasting performance of the model on a short time span is unfortunately not very impressive. Also, a single increase in the SARS-CoV-2 concentration can impact the COVID-19 cases in an inverted-U shape pattern with the maximum impact occur in the third week after. The flexibility of this approach and easy-to-follow explanations are suitable for many different locations where the wastewater surveillance system has been implemented.",Epidemic Forecasting

In particular, our goal was to generate epidemiological data based on natural mechanism of transmission of this disease assuming random interactions of a large-finite number of individuals in very short distance ranges. In the simulation we also take into account the stochastic character of the individuals in a finite population and given densities of people. On the other hand, we include in the simulation the appropriate statistical distributions for the parameters characterizing this disease. An important outcome of our work, besides the generated epidemic curves, is the methodology of determining the effective reproductive number during the main part of the daily new cases of the epidemic. Since this quantity constitutes a fundamental parameter of the SIR-based epidemic models, we also studied how it is affected by small variations of the incubation time and the crucial distance distributions, and furthermore, by the degree of quarantine measures. In addition, we compare our qualitative results with those of selected real epidemiological data.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Early efforts to predict hospital bed needs focused on deriving predictions from SIR models, largely at the level of countries, provinces, or states. In the USA, these models rely on data reported by state health agencies. However, predicting disease and hospitalization dynamics at the state level is complicated by geographic variation in disease parameters. In addition, it is difficult to make forecasts early in a pandemic due to minimal data. Bayesian approaches that allow models to be specified with informed prior information from areas that have already completed a disease curve can serve as prior estimates for areas that are beginning their curve. Here, a Bayesian non-linear regression (Weibull function) was used to forecast cumulative and active COVID-19 hospitalizations for SD, USA, based on data available up to 2020-07-22. As expected, early forecasts were dominated by prior information, which was derived from New York City. Importantly, hospitalization trends differed within South Dakota due to early peaks in an urban area, followed by later peaks in rural areas of the state. Combining these trends led to altered forecasts with relevant policy implications.

Methods: We have specified a novel multi-parameter generalized logistic growth model, which does not only look at the trend of the data, but also includes explanatory covariates, using a quasi-Poisson regression specification to account for overdispersion of the count data. We fitted our model to data from the onset of the disease (February 28) until September 15. Estimating the parameters from our model, we predicted the growth of the epidemic for the evolution of the disease until the end of October 2020. We also evaluated via simulations different fictional scenarios for the outcome of alternative policies (those analyses are included in the Supplementary Material). Results and Conclusions: The evolution of the disease has not followed an exponential growth, but rather, stabilized and moved downward after July 2020, starting to increase again after the implementation of the Step-by-Step policy. The lockdown policy implemented in the majority of the country has proven effective in stopping the spread, and the lockdown-relaxation policies, however gradual, appear to have caused an upward break in the trend.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We also investigate some conditions for the extinction and persistence of the disease. We calculate the threshold of the stochastic epidemic system which determines the extinction or permanence of the disease at different intensities of the stochastic noises. This threshold is denoted by xi which depends on white and jump noises. The effects of these noises on the dynamics of the model are studied. The numerical experiments show that the random perturbation introduced in the stochastic model suppresses disease outbreak as compared to its deterministic counterpart. In other words, the impact of the noises on the extinction and persistence is high. When the noise is large or small, our numerical findings show that COVID-19 vanishes from the population if xi < 1 ; whereas the epidemic cannot go out of control if xi > 1 . From this, we observe that white noise and jump noise have a significant effect on the spread of COVID-19 infection, i.e., we can conclude that the stochastic model is more realistic than the deterministic one. Finally, to illustrate this phenomenon, we put some numerical simulations.",Epidemic Forecasting

The model is constructed from the corresponding ordinary differential model by introducing two independent environmental white noises in transmission coefficients for above mentioned classes - one noise for infected and hospitalized individuals and the other for superspreaders.

For the modeling process, the data published by the daily technical report COVID-19 in Mexico from March 19th to September 30th were used. The data published in the month of October were included to carry out the prediction. The results show a satisfactory comparison between the real data and those obtained by both models with a R(2) > 0.999. The Levenberg-Marquardt and BFGS quasi-Newton optimization algorithm were favorable for fitting the coefficients during learning in the ANN model due to their fast and precision, respectively. On the other hand, the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm fitted the parameters of the Gompertz model faster by minimizing the sum of squares. Therefore, the ANN model better fits the real data using ten coefficients. However, the Gompertz model using three parameters converges in less computational time. In the prediction, the inverse ANN model was solved by a genetic algorithm obtaining the best precision with a maximum error of 2.22% per day, as opposed to the 5.48% of the Gompertz model with respect to the real data reported from November 1st to 15th. Finally, according to the coefficients and parameters obtained from both models with recent data, a total of 109,724 cumulative deaths for the inverse ANN model and 100,482 cumulative deaths for the Gompertz model were predicted for the end of 2020.",Epidemic Forecasting

The proposed model can have four equilibrium states based on different parametric conditions. The local and global stability conditions for awareness-free, disease-free equilibrium are studied. Using Lyapunov function theory and LaSalle invariance principle, the disease-free equilibrium is shown globally asymptotically stable under some parametric constraints. The existence of unique awareness-free, endemic equilibrium and unique endemic equilibrium is presented. We calibrate our proposed model parameters to fit daily cases and deaths from Colombia and India. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the transmission rate and the learning factor related to awareness of susceptibles are very crucial for reduction in disease-related deaths. Finally, we assess the impact of prosocial awareness during the outbreak and compare this strategy with popular control measures.

Our objective is to provide a framework of methodology for quantifying the combined effects of entry restrictions and travel quarantine on managing the importation risk of COVID-19 and other pandemics by leveraging different sets of parameters. METHODS: Three major categories of control measures on controlling importation risk were parameterized and modelled by the framework: 1) entry restrictions, 2) travel quarantine, and 3) domestic containment measures. Integrating the parameterized intensity of control measures, a modified SEIR model was developed to simulate the case importation and local epidemic under different scenarios of global epidemic dynamics. A web-based tool was also provided to enable interactive visualization of epidemic simulation. RESULTS: The simulated number of case importation and local spread modelled by the proposed framework of methods fitted well to the historical epidemic curve of China and Singapore. Based on the simulation results, the total numbers of infected cases when reducing 30% of visitor arrivals would be 88.4 (IQR 87.5-89.6) and 58.8 (IQR 58.3-59.5) times more than those when reducing 99% of visitor arrivals in mainland China and Singapore respectively, assuming actual time-varying Rt and travel quarantine policy. If the number of global daily new infections reached 100,000, 85%-91% of inbound travels should be reduced to keep the daily new infected number below 100 for a country with a similar travel volume as Singapore (daily 52,000 tourist arrivals in 2019). Whereas if the number was lower than 10,000, the daily new infected case would be less than 100 even with no entry restrictions. DISCUSSIONS: We proposed a framework that first estimated the intensity of travel restrictions and local containment measures for countries since the first overseas imported case. Our approach then quantified the combined effects of entry restrictions and travel quarantine using a modified SEIR model to simulate the potential epidemic spread under hypothetical intensities of these control measures. We also developed a web-based system that enables interactive simulation, which could serve as a valuable tool for health system administrators to assess policy effects on managing the importation risk. By leveraging different sets of parameters, it could adapt to any specific country and specific type of epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: This framework has provided a valuable tool to parameterize the intensity of control measures, simulate both the case importation and local epidemic, and quantify the combined effects of entry restrictions and travel quarantine on managing the importation risk.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We apply a method we developed to account for the high false negative rates of diagnostic RT-PCR tests for detecting an active SARS-CoV-2 infection in a classic SEIR model. The number of unascertained cases and false negatives being unobservable in a real study, population-based serosurveys can help validate model projections. Applying our method to training data from Delhi, India, during March 15-June 30, 2020, we estimate the underreporting factor for cases at 34-53 (deaths: 8-13) on July 10, 2020, largely consistent with the findings of the first round of serosurveys for Delhi (done during June 27-July 10, 2020) with an estimated 22.86% IgG antibody prevalence, yielding estimated underreporting factors of 30-42 for cases. Together, these imply approximately 96-98% cases in Delhi remained unreported (July 10, 2020). Updated calculations using training data during March 15-December 31, 2020 yield estimated underreporting factor for cases at 13-22 (deaths: 3-7) on January 23, 2021, which are again consistent with the latest (fifth) round of serosurveys for Delhi (done during January 15-23, 2021) with an estimated 56.13% IgG antibody prevalence, yielding an estimated range for the underreporting factor for cases at 17-21. Together, these updated estimates imply approximately 92-96% cases in Delhi remained unreported (January 23, 2021). Such model-based estimates, updated with latest data, provide a viable alternative to repeated resource-intensive serosurveys for tracking unreported cases and deaths and gauging the true extent of the pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Transmission
33963235,Tracking the time course of reproduction number and lockdown's effect on human behaviour during SARS-CoV-2 epidemic: nonparametric estimation.,,"Understanding the SARS-CoV-2 dynamics has been subject of intense research in the last months. In particular, accurate modeling of lockdown effects on human behaviour and epidemic evolution is a key issue in order e.g. to inform health-care decisions on emergency management. In this regard, the compartmental and spatial models so far proposed use parametric descriptions of the contact rate, often assuming a time-invariant effect of the lockdown. In this paper we show that these assumptions may lead to erroneous evaluations on the ongoing pandemic. Thus, we develop a new class of nonparametric compartmental models able to describe how the impact of the lockdown varies in time. Our estimation strategy does not require significant Bayes prior information and exploits regularization theory. Hospitalized data are mapped into an infinite-dimensional space, hence obtaining a function which takes into account also how social distancing measures and people's growing awareness of infection's risk evolves as time progresses. This also permits to reconstruct a continuous-time profile of SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number with a resolution never reached before in the literature. When applied to data collected in Lombardy, the most affected Italian region, our model illustrates how people behaviour changed during the restrictions and its importance to contain the epidemic. Results also indicate that, at the end of the lockdown, around [Formula: see text] of people in Lombardy and [Formula: see text] in Italy was affected by SARS-CoV-2, with the fatality rate being 1.14%. Then, we discuss how the situation evolved after the end of the lockdown showing that the reproduction number dangerously increased in the summer, due to holiday relax, reaching values larger than one on August 1, 2020. Finally, we also document how Italy faced the second wave of infection in the last part of 2020. Since several countries still observe a growing epidemic and others could be subject to other waves, the proposed reproduction number tracking methodology can be of great help to health care authorities to prevent SARS-CoV-2 diffusion or to assess the impact of lockdown restrictions on human behaviour to contain the spread.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

During a public health emergency, estimating all cause excess deaths above an expected level of death can provide a more reliable picture of the mortality burden. Here, we aim to estimate the absolute and relative mortality impact of COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. METHODS: We obtained weekly mortality time series due to all causes for Mexico, and by gender, and geographic region from 2015 to 2020. We also compiled surveillance data on COVID-19 cases and deaths to assess the timing and intensity of the pandemic and assembled weekly series of the proportion of tweets about 'death' from Mexico to assess the correlation between people's media interaction about 'death' and the rise in pandemic deaths. We estimated all-cause excess mortality rates and mortality rate ratio increase over baseline by fitting Serfling regression models and forecasted the total excess deaths for Mexico for the first 4 weeks of 2021 using the generalized logistic growth model. RESULTS: We estimated the all-cause excess mortality rate associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico in 2020 at 26.10 per 10,000 population, which corresponds to 333,538 excess deaths. Males had about 2-fold higher excess mortality rate (33.99) compared to females (18.53). Mexico City reported the highest excess death rate (63.54) and RR (2.09) compared to rest of the country (excess rate = 23.25, RR = 1.62). While COVID-19 deaths accounted for only 38.64% of total excess deaths in Mexico, our forecast estimate that Mexico has accumulated a total of ~ 61,610 [95% PI: 60,003, 63,216] excess deaths in the first 4 weeks of 2021. Proportion of tweets was significantly correlated with the excess mortality (rho = 0.508 [95% CI: 0.245, 0.701], p-value = 0.0004). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily affected Mexico. The lab-confirmed COVID-19 deaths accounted for only 38.64% of total all cause excess deaths (333,538) in Mexico in 2020. This reflects either the effect of low testing rates in Mexico, or the surge in number of deaths due to other causes during the pandemic. A model-based forecast indicates that an average of 61,610 excess deaths have occurred in January 2021.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Model prediction method can serve as a pre-screening tool to quickly estimate the effectiveness of UV254 irradiation on emerging or unculturable viruses. In this study, an improved prediction model was applied to estimate UV254 photolysis kinetics of viral genomes (kpred, genome) based on the genome sequences and their photoreactivity and to correlate with the experimental virus infectivity loss kinetics (kexp, infectivity). The UV254 inactivation data of 102 viruses (including 2 dsRNA, 65 ssRNA, 33 dsDNA and 2 ssDNA viruses) were collected from the published experimental data with kexp, infectivity ranging from 0.016 to 3.49 cm(2) mJ(-1). The model had fairly good performance in predicting the virus susceptibility to UV254 irradiation except dsRNA viruses (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.64) and 70% of kpred, genome fell in the range of 1/2 to 2 times of kexp, infectivity. The positive deviation of the model often occurred for photoresistant viruses with low kexp, infectivity less than 0.20 cm(2) mJ(-1) (e.g., Adenovirus, Papovaviridae and Retroviridae). We also applied this model to predict the UV254 inactivation rate of SARS-CoV-2 (kpred, genome = 3.168 cm(2) mJ(-1)) and a UV dose of 3 mJ cm(-2) seemed to be able to achieve a 2-log removal by conservative calculation using 1/2kpred, genome value. This prediction method can be used as a prescreening tool to assess the effectiveness of UV254 irradiation for emerging/unculturable viruses in water or wastewater treatment.",Epidemic Forecasting

Our model is in the SEIR class, which means that when a susceptible individual (S) becomes infected, he/she is first exposed (E), i.e. not yet contagious. Then he/she becomes infectious (I) for a certain length of time, during which he/she may infect susceptible individuals around him/her, and finally becomes removed (R), that is, either immune or dead. The specificity of our model is that it assumes a very general probability distribution for the pair of exposed and infectious periods. The law of large numbers limit of such a model is a model with memory (the future evolution of the model depends not only upon its present state, but also upon its past). We present theoretical results linking the (unobserved) parameters of the model to various quantities which are more easily measured during the early stages of an epidemic. We then apply these results to estimate the state of the COVID-19 epidemic in France, using available information on the infection fatality ratio and on the distribution of the exposed and infectious periods.

By modelling the calls as background (proportional to population) plus signal (proportional to infected), we fit the calls in Province of Buenos Aires (Argentina) with coefficient of determination R (2) > 0.85. This result allows us to estimate the number of cases given the number of calls from a specific district, days before the laboratory results are available. We validate the algorithm with real data. We show how to use the algorithm to track on-stream the epidemic, and present the Early Outbreak Alarm to detect outbreaks in advance of laboratory results. One key point in the developed algorithm is a detailed track of the uncertainties in the estimations, since the alarm uses the significance of the observables as a main indicator to detect an anomaly. We present the details of the explicit example in Villa Azul (Quilmes) where this tool resulted crucial to control an outbreak on time.

The first model is derived from a set of ordinary differential equations that incorporates the rates at which population transitions take place among classes. The other is a particle model, which is a specific case of crowd simulation model, in which the disease is transmitted through particle collisions and infection rates are varied by adjusting the particle velocities. The parameters of these two models are tuned using information on COVID-19 from the literature and country-specific data, including the effect of restrictions as they were imposed and lifted.

33952194,Estimating effects of intervention measures on COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan taking account of improving diagnostic capabilities using a modelling approach.,,"BACKGROUND: Although by late February 2020 the COVID-19 epidemic was effectively controlled in Wuhan, China, estimating the effects of interventions, such as transportation restrictions and quarantine measures, on the early COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Wuhan is critical for guiding future virus containment strategies. Since the exact number of infected cases is unknown, the number of documented cases was used by many disease transmission models to infer epidemiological parameters. This means that it was possible to produce biased estimates of epidemiological parameters and hence of the effects of intervention measures, because the percentage of all cases that were documented changed during the first 2 months of the epidemic, as a consequence of a gradually improving diagnostic capability. METHODS: To overcome these limitations, we constructed a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) model, accounting for intervention measures and temporal changes in the proportion of new documented infections out of total new infections, to characterize the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan across different stages of the outbreak. Pre-symptomatic transmission was taken into account in our model, and all epidemiological parameters were estimated using the Particle Markov-chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) method. RESULTS: Our model captured the local Wuhan epidemic pattern as two-peak transmission dynamics, with one peak on February 4 and the other on February 12, 2020. The impact of intervention measures determined the timing of the first peak, leading to an 86% drop in the Re from 3.23 (95% CI, 2.22 to 4.20) to 0.45 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.69). The improved diagnostic capability led to the second peak and a higher proportion of documented infections. Our estimated proportion of new documented infections out of the total new infections increased from 11% (95% CI 1-43%) to 28% (95% CI 4-62%) after January 26 when more detection kits were released. After the introduction of a new diagnostic criterion (case definition) on February 12, a higher proportion of daily infected cases were documented (49% (95% CI 7-79%)).

This document proposes a data-driven approach to nowcast Rt based on previous observations' statistical behavior. As more information arrives, the method naturally becomes more precise about the final count of confirmed positives. Our method's strength is that it is based on the self-reported onset of symptoms, in contrast to other methods that use the daily report's count to infer this quantity. We show that our approach may be the foundation for determining useful epidemy tracking indicators.",Epidemic Forecasting

DESIGN: Rapid scoping review of peer-reviewed literature from 1 January to 5 December 2020 using the LitCovid database and the Cochrane library. SETTING: International studies on the infectiousness of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. PARTICIPANTS: Studies were selected for inclusion if they defined asymptomatics as a separate cohort distinct from presymptomatics and if they provided a quantitative measure of the infectiousness of asymptomatics relative to symptomatics. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: PCR result (PCR studies), the rate of infection (mathematical modelling studies) and secondary attack rate (contact tracing studies) - in each case from asymptomatic in comparison with symptomatic individuals. RESULTS: There are only a limited number of published studies that report estimates of relative infectiousness of asymptomatic compared with symptomatic individuals. 12 studies were included after the screening process. Significant differences exist in the definition of infectiousness. PCR studies in general show no difference in shedding levels between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals; however, the number of study subjects is generally limited. Two modelling studies estimate relative infectiousness to be 0.43 and 0.57, but both of these were more reflective of the infectiousness of undocumented rather than asymptomatic cases. The results from contact tracing studies include estimates of relative infectiousness of 0, but with insufficient evidence to conclude that it is significantly different from 1. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable heterogeneity in estimates of relative infectiousness highlighting the need for further investigation of this important parameter. It is not possible to provide any conclusive estimate of relative infectiousness, as the estimates from the reviewed studies varied between 0 and 1.",Diagnosis;Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission
33945149,Dynamic modelling to identify mitigation strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic.,,"Relevant pandemic-spread scenario simulations can provide guiding principles for containment and mitigation policies. We devised a compartmental model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies with a main focus on mass testing. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries, and the number of COVID-19-inflicted deaths. We assumed that COVID-19 survivors are immune (e.g., mutations are not considered) and that the virus is primarily passed on by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intensive care units. The model parameters have been chosen in a plausible range based on information found in the literature, but it is easily adaptable, i.e., these values can be replaced by updated information any time. We compared infection rates, the total number of people getting infected and the number of deaths in different scenarios. Social distancing or mass testing can contain or drastically reduce the infections and the predicted number of deaths when compared with a situation without mitigation. We found that mass testing alone and subsequent isolation of detected cases can be an effective mitigation strategy, alone and in combination with social distancing. It is of high practical relevance that a relationship between testing frequency and the effective reproduction number of the virus can be provided. However, unless one assumes that the virus can be globally defeated by reducing the number of infected persons to zero, testing must be upheld, albeit at reduced intensity, to prevent subsequent waves of infection. The model suggests that testing strategies can be equally effective as social distancing, though at much lower economic costs. We discuss how our mathematical model may help to devise an optimal mix of mitigation strategies against the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we quantify the theoretical limit of contact tracing and by how much the effect of testing is enhanced, if applied to sub-populations with increased exposure risk or prevalence.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Measures envisaged include national or local lockdown and travels ban. In the DRC, these measures have seriously prejudiced the economy of the country which is mainly informal. In this paper, a mathematical model for the spread of Covid-19 in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) taking into account the vulnerability of congolese economy is proposed. To mitigate the spreading of the virus no national lockdown is proposed, only individuals affected by the virus or suspicious are quarantined. The reproduction number for the Covid-19 is calculated and numerical simulations are performed using Python software. A clear advice for policymakers is deduced from the forecasting of the model.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Due to this infection, many countries of the world suffers from great economic loss. The researchers around the world are very active to make a plan and policy for its early eradication. The government officials have taken full action for the eradication of this virus using different possible control strategies. It is the first priority of the researchers to develop safe vaccine against this deadly disease to minimize the infection. Different approaches have been made in this regards for its elimination. In this study, we formulate a mathematical epidemic model to analyze the dynamical behavior and transmission patterns of this new pandemic. We consider the environmental viral concentration in the model to better study the disease incidence in a community. Initially, the model is constructed with the derivative of integer-order. The classical epidemic model is then reconstructed with the fractional order operator in the form of Atangana-Baleanu derivative with the nonsingular and nonlocal kernel in order to analyze the dynamics of Coronavirus infection in a better way. A well-known estimation approach is used to estimate model parameters from the COVID-19 cases reported in Saudi Arabia from March 1 till August 20, 2020. After the procedure of parameters estimation, we explore some basic mathematical analysis of the fractional model. The stability results are provided for the disease free case using fractional stability concepts. Further, the uniqueness and existence results will be shown using the Picard-Lendelof approach. Moreover, an efficient numerical scheme has been proposed to obtain the solution of the model numerically. Finally, using the real fitted parameters, we depict many simulation results in order to demonstrate the importance of various model parameters and the memory index on disease dynamics and possible eradication.",Epidemic Forecasting

This makes it possible for administrative sectors and the population itself to become aware and act more precisely. In this work, a machine learning model based on the multilayer Perceptron artificial neural network structure was used, which effectively predicts the behavior of the series mentioned in up to six days. The model, which is trained with data from 30 countries together in a 20-day context, is assessed using global and local MSE and MAE measures. For the construction of training and test sets, four time series (number of: accumulated infected cases, new cases, accumulated deaths and new deaths) from each country are used, which are started on the day of the first confirmed infection case. In order to soften the sudden transitions between samples, a moving average filter with a window size 3 and a normalization by maximum value were used. It is intended to make the model's predictions available online, collaborating with the fight against the pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting
33935582,Universal features of epidemic models under social distancing guidelines.,covid-19;epidemic models;nonpharmaceutical intervention;social distancing,"Social distancing as a form of nonpharmaceutical intervention has been enacted in many countries as a form of mitigating the spread of COVID-19. There has been a large interest in mathematical modeling to aid in the prediction of both the total infected population and virus-related deaths, as well as to aid government agencies in decision making. As the virus continues to spread, there are both economic and sociological incentives to minimize time spent with strict distancing mandates enforced, and/or to adopt periodically relaxed distancing protocols, which allow for scheduled economic activity. The main objective of this study is to reduce the disease burden in a population, here measured as the peak of the infected population, while simultaneously minimizing the length of time the population is socially distanced, utilizing both a single period of social distancing as well as periodic relaxation. We derive a linear relationship among the optimal start time and duration of a single interval of social distancing from an approximation of the classic epidemic SIR model. Furthermore, we see a sharp phase transition region in start times for a single pulse of distancing, where the peak of the infected population changes rapidly; notably, this transition occurs well before one would intuitively expect. By numerical investigation of more sophisticated epidemiological models designed specifically to describe the COVID-19 pandemic, we see that all share remarkably similar dynamic characteristics when contact rates are subject to periodic or one-shot changes, and hence lead us to conclude that these features are universal in epidemic models. On the other hand, the nonlinearity of epidemic models leads to non-monotone behavior of the peak of infected population under periodic relaxation of social distancing policies. This observation led us to hypothesize that an additional single interval social distancing at a proper time can significantly decrease the infected peak of periodic policies, and we verified this improvement numerically. While synchronous quarantine and social distancing mandates across populations effectively minimize the spread of an epidemic over the world, relaxation decisions should not be enacted at the same time for different populations.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

33935138,Estimating the Cumulative Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and the Infection Fatality Ratio in Light of Waning Antibodies.,,"BACKGROUND: Serology tests can identify previous infections and facilitate estimation of the number of total infections. However, immunoglobulins targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported to wane below the detectable level of serologic assays (which is not necessarily equivalent to the duration of protective immunity). We estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection from serology studies, accounting for expected levels of antibody acquisition (seroconversion) and waning (seroreversion), and apply this framework using data from New York City and Connecticut. METHODS: We estimated time from seroconversion to seroreversion and infection fatality ratio (IFR) using mortality data from March to October 2020 and population-level cross-sectional seroprevalence data from April to August 2020 in New York City and Connecticut. We then estimated the daily seroprevalence and cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The estimated average time from seroconversion to seroreversion was 3-4 months. The estimated IFR was 1.1% (95% credible interval, 1.0%, 1.2%) in New York City and 1.4% (1.1, 1.7%) in Connecticut. The estimated daily seroprevalence declined after a peak in the spring. The estimated cumulative incidence reached 26.8% (24.2%, 29.7%) at the end of September in New York City and 8.8% (7.1%, 11.3%) in Connecticut, higher than maximum seroprevalence measures (22.1% and 6.1%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is underestimated using cross-sectional serology data without adjustment for waning antibodies. Our approach can help quantify the magnitude of underestimation and adjust estimates for waning antibodies.",Diagnosis;Epidemic Forecasting

This deadly virus is infecting people rapidly and has targeted 4.93 million people across the world, with 227K people being infected only in Italy. Cases of nCOV are quickly increasing whereas the number of nCOV test kits available in hospitals are limited. Under these conditions, an automated system for the classification of patients into nCOV positive and negative cases, is a much needed tool against the pandemic, helping in a selective use of the limited number of test kits. In this research, Convolutional Neural Network-based models (one block VGG, two block VGG, three block VGG, four block VGG, LetNet-5, AlexNet, and Resnet-50) have been employed for the detection of Corona-virus and SARS_MERS infected patients, distinguishing them from the healthy subjects, using lung X-ray scans, which has proven to be a challenging task, due to overlapping characteristics of different corona virus types. Furthermore, LSTM model has been used for time series forecasting of nCOV cases, in the following 10 days, in Italy. The evaluation results obtained, proved that the VGG1 model distinguishes the three classes at an accuracy of almost 91%, as compared to other models, whereas the approach based on the LSTM predicts the number of nCOV cases with 99% accuracy.",Diagnosis;Epidemic Forecasting
33929002,A stochastic compartmental model to simulate the Covid-19 epidemic spread on a simple network.,diffusion on networks;epidemic models;retarded equation,"The recent Covid-19 epidemic has pointed out the inadequacy of the plans applied by industrial countries to limit the epidemic spread and frailty of the global economy to cope with a pandemic. Many countries were forced to a global lockdown with a great socio-economic impact. In Italy, one of the problems was the complex mobility network structure of the Northern regions that made ineffective the attempts to isolate the initial hotspots. In the paper we study a simple model that simulates the epidemic spread on a community network that may exchange population according to a daily mobility rate. In each community the epidemic evolution is provided by a stochastic compartmental model whose parameters are tuned to reproduce the Covid-19 evolution observed in Italy before the global lockdown policies. We initially study the delay in the epidemic spread due to the finite local mobility by proposing a power law relation for the increasing of the infection peak time in each node and the network distance from the initial node where the epidemic starts. We consider two scenarios to study the effectiveness of local lockdown policies: the presence of two clusters weakly connected by the mobility or a homogeneous chain of communities that exchange the population at a fixed rate. In both cases we show the existence of a threshold effect, in a probabilistic sense, for the effectiveness of lockdown policies as a function of the delay time at which such policies are applied, or of the network distance from the outbreak node.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The model, which makes use of a limited number of parameters, in spite of its simplicity is able of capturing the essential physical features of the epidemic spread highlighting the essential role of the restrictive measures and in particular the timeliness of their application for the containment of the most dramatic consequences.

For flexibility in epidemic case reporting data modeling, we combined an exponential growth curve for the early epidemic phase with a flexible growth curve to account for the potential change in growth pattern after implementation of containment measures. We also fitted logistic regression models to recoveries and deaths from the confirmed positive cases. In addition, the growth curves were integrated into a SIQR (Susceptible, Infective, Quarantined, Recovered) model framework to provide an overview on the modeled epidemic wave. We focused on the estimation of: (1) the delay between the appearance of the first infectious case in the population and the outbreak (""epidemic latency period""); (2) the duration of the exponential growth phase; (3) the basic and the time-varying reproduction numbers; and (4) the peaks (time and size) in confirmed positive cases, active cases and new infections.

The delays and the efficacies of the doses are parameters, which can be fixed in the model for each concrete experimentation. The disease-free equilibrium point is characterized as well as its stability properties, while it is seen that no endemic equilibrium point exists.

Daily collected data on infection cases and hospitalizations informed decision makers on the ongoing pandemic emergency, enabling the design of diversified countermeasures, from behavioral policies to full lockdowns, to curb the virus spread. In this context, mechanistic models could represent valuable tools to optimize the timing and stringency of interventions, and to reveal non-trivial properties of the pandemic dynamics that could improve the design of suitable guidelines for future epidemics. We performed a retrospective analysis of the Italian epidemic evolution up to mid-December 2020 to gain insight into the main characteristics of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, prior to the emergence of new mutations and the vaccination campaign. We defined a time-varying optimization procedure to calibrate a refined version of the SIDARTHE (Susceptible, Infected, Diagnosed, Ailing, Recognized, Threatened, Healed, Extinct) model and hence accurately reconstruct the epidemic trajectory. We then derived additional features of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy not directly retrievable from reported data, such as the estimate of the day zero of infection in late November 2019 and the estimate of the spread of undetected infection.

We computed the expected mortality by taking into account the declining trend and the seasonality in mortality in the two countries over the past 20 years. From the excess mortality in Sweden in 2019/20, we estimated the YLL attributed to COVID-19 using the life expectancy in different age groups. We adjusted this estimate for possible displacement using an auto-regressive model for the year-to-year variations in excess mortality. We found that excess all-cause mortality over the epidemic year, July 2019 to July 2020, was 517 (95%CI = (12, 1074)) in Norway and 4329 [3331, 5325] in Sweden. There were 255 COVID-19 related deaths reported in Norway, and 5741 in Sweden, that year. During the epidemic period of 11 March-11 November, there were 6247 reported COVID-19 deaths and 5517 (4701, 6330) excess deaths in Sweden. We estimated that the number of YLL attributed to COVID-19 in Sweden was 45,850 [13,915, 80,276] without adjusting for mortality displacement and 43,073 (12,160, 85,451) after adjusting for the displacement accounted for by the auto-regressive model.

Therefore, accurately predicting the dynamics of the pandemic can be very beneficial. Two main elements required for developing reliable predictions include: (1) a predictive model and (2) an indicator of the current condition and status of the pandemic. As a pandemic indicator, we used the effective reproduction number (Rt), which is defined as the number of new infections transmitted by a single contagious individual in a population that may no longer be fully susceptible. To bring the pandemic under control, Rt must be less than one. To eliminate the pandemic, Rt should be close to zero. Therefore, this value may serve as a strong indicator of the current status of the pandemic. For a predictive model, we used graph neural networks (GNNs), a method that combines graphical analysis with the structure of neural networks. We developed two types of GNN models, including: (1) graph-theory-based neural networks (GTNN) and (2) neighborhood-based neural networks (NGNN). The nodes in both graphs indicated individual states in the United States. While the GTNN model's edges document functional connectivity between states, those in the NGNN model link neighboring states to one another. We trained both models with Rt numbers collected over the previous four days and asked them to predict the following day for all states in the United States. The performance of these models was evaluated with the datasets that included Rt values reflecting conditions from 22 January through 26 November 2020 (before the start of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States). To determine the efficiency, we compared the results of two models with each other and with those generated by a baseline Long short-term memory (LSTM) model.

While, for the former reliable data are available (in the form of number of hospitalization and/or beds in intensive care units), this is not the case of the latter. Hence, analytical tools designed to generate reliable forecast and future scenarios, should be implemented to help decision-makers to plan ahead (e.g., medical structures and equipment). Previous work of one of the authors shows that an alternative formulation of the Test Positivity Rate (TPR), i.e., the proportion of the number of persons tested positive in a given day, exhibits a strong correlation with the number of patients admitted in hospitals and intensive care units. In this paper, we investigate the lagged correlation structure between the newly defined TPR and the hospitalized people time series, exploiting a rigorous statistical model, the Seasonal Auto Regressive Moving Average (SARIMA). The rigorous analytical framework chosen, i.e., the stochastic processes theory, allowed for a reliable forecasting about 12 days ahead of those quantities. The proposed approach would also allow decision-makers to forecast the number of beds in hospitals and intensive care units needed 12 days ahead. The obtained results show that a standardized TPR index is a valuable metric to monitor the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic. The index can be computed on daily basis and it is probably one of the best forecasting tools available today for predicting hospital and intensive care units overload, being an optimal compromise between simplicity of calculation and accuracy.",Epidemic Forecasting
33915940,Exploring COVID-19 Daily Records of Diagnosed Cases and Fatalities Based on Simple Nonparametric Methods.,covid-19 pandemic;sars-cov-2;case-fatality ratio;nonparametric methods,"Containment strategies to combat epidemics such as SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 require the availability of epidemiological parameters, e.g., the effective reproduction number. Parametric models such as the commonly used susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartment models fitted to observed incidence time series have limitations due to the time-dependency of the parameters. Furthermore, fatalities are delayed with respect to the counts of new cases, and the reproduction cycle leads to periodic patterns in incidence time series. Therefore, based on comprehensible nonparametric methods including time-delay correlation analyses, estimates of crucial parameters that characterise the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on the German epidemic are presented using publicly available time-series data on prevalence and fatalities. The estimates for Germany are compared with the results for seven other countries (France, Italy, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Spain, Switzerland, and Brazil). The duration from diagnosis to death resulting from delay-time correlations turns out to be 13 days with high accuracy for Germany and Switzerland. For the other countries, the time-to-death durations have wider confidence intervals. With respect to the German data, the two time series of new cases and fatalities exhibit a strong coherence. Based on the time lag between diagnoses and deaths, properly delayed asymptotic as well as instantaneous fatality-case ratios are calculated. The temporal median of the instantaneous fatality-case ratio with time lag of 13 days between cases and deaths for Germany turns out to be 0.02. Time courses of asymptotic fatality-case ratios are presented for other countries, which substantially differ during the first half of the pandemic but converge to a narrow range with standard deviation 0.0057 and mean 0.024. Similar results are obtained from comparing time courses of instantaneous fatality-case ratios with optimal delay for the 8 exemplarily chosen countries. The basic reproduction number, R0, for Germany is estimated to be between 2.4 and 3.4 depending on the generation time, which is estimated based on a delay autocorrelation analysis. Resonances at about 4 days and 7 days are observed, partially attributable to weekly periodicity of sampling. The instantaneous (time-dependent) reproduction number is estimated from the incident (counts of new) cases, thus allowing us to infer the temporal behaviour of the reproduction number during the epidemic course. The time course of the reproduction number turns out to be consistent with the time-dependent per capita growth.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The employment of hybrid models (i.e., LSTM-CNN and GAN-GRU) is expected to eventually improve the forecasting accuracy of COVID-19 future trends. The performance of the investigated deep learning and machine learning models was tested using confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases time-series data from seven impacted countries: Brazil, France, India, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the US. The results reveal that hybrid deep learning models can efficiently forecast COVID-19 cases.

This information is very relevant so that public health organizations can distribute financial resources efficiently and take appropriate containment measures. In this research, we compare different time series methodologies to predict the number of confirmed cases of and deaths from COVID-19 in Chile. METHODS: The methodology used in this research consisted of modeling cases of both confirmed diagnoses and deaths from COVID-19 in Chile using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA henceforth) models, Exponential Smoothing techniques, and Poisson models for time-dependent count data. Additionally, we evaluated the accuracy of the predictions using a training set and a test set. RESULTS: The dataset used in this research indicated that the most appropriate model is the ARIMA time series model for predicting the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, whereas for predicting the number of deaths from COVID-19 in Chile, the most suitable approach is the damped trend method. CONCLUSION: The ARIMA models are an alternative to modeling the behavior of the spread of COVID-19; however, depending on the characteristics of the dataset, other methodologies can better predict the behavior of these records, for example, the Holt-Winter method implemented with time-dependent count data.",Epidemic Forecasting

The health department of the fourth largest city in the U.S. recognized that sound estimates of viral impact were needed to inform decision-making. METHODS: Adapting standardized disaster research methodology in September 2020, the city was divided into high and low strata based on RT-PCR positivity rates, and census block groups within each stratum were randomly selected with probability proportional to size, followed by random selection of households within each group. Using two immunoassays, the proportion of infected individuals was estimated for the city, as well as by positivity rate and by sociodemographic and other characteristics. The degree of under ascertainment of seroprevalence was estimated based on RT-PCR positive cases. RESULTS: Seroprevalence was estimated to be 14% with a near two-fold difference in areas with high (18%) versus low (10%) RT-PCR positivity rates and was four times higher compared to case-based surveillance data. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence was higher than previously reported and is greater than that estimated from RT-PCR data. Results will be used to inform public health decisions about testing, outreach, and vaccine rollout.",Diagnosis;Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33907736,Computational Model on COVID-19 Pandemic Using Probabilistic Cellular Automata.,lattice epidemic;mathematical model of epidemiology;probabilistic cellular automata,"Since March, 2020, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been designated as a pandemic by World Health Organization. This disease is highly infectious and potentially fatal, causing a global public health concern. To contain the spread of COVID-19, governments are adopting nationwide interventions, like lockdown, containment and quarantine, restrictions on travel, cancelling social events and extensive testing. To understand the effects of these measures on the control of the epidemic in a data-driven manner, we propose a probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) based epidemiological model. The transitions associated with the model is driven by data available on chronology, symptoms, pathogenesis and transmissivity of the virus. By arguing that the lattice-based model captures the features of the dynamics along with the existing fluctuations, we perform rigorous computational analyses of the model to take into account of the spatial dynamics of social distancing measures imposed on the people. Considering the probabilistic behavioral aspects associated with mitigation strategies, we study the model considering factors like population density and testing efficiency. Using the model, we focus on the variability of epidemic dynamics data for different countries, and point out the reasons behind these contrasting observations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to model COVID-19 spread using PCA that gives us both spatial and temporal variations of the infection spread with the insight about the contributions of different infection parameters.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33907451,Trend Analysis and Forecasting the Spread of COVID-19 Pandemic in Ethiopia Using Box-Jenkins Modeling Procedure.,arima models;covid-19;ethiopia;forecast;trend,"Introduction: COVID-19, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, is spreading rapidly across the world, and the severity of this pandemic is rising in Ethiopia. The main objective of the study was to analyze the trend and forecast the spread of COVID-19 and to develop an appropriate statistical forecast model. Methodology: Data on the daily spread between 13 March, 2020 and 31 August 2020 were collected for the development of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Stationarity testing, parameter testing and model diagnosis were performed. In addition, candidate models were obtained using autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation functions (PACF). Finally, the fitting, selection and prediction accuracy of the ARIMA models was evaluated using the RMSE and MAPE model selection criteria. Results: A total of 51,910 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported from 13 March to 31 August 2020. The total recovered and death rates as of 31 August 2020 were 37.2% and 1.57%, respectively, with a high level of increase after the mid of August, 2020. In this study, ARIMA (0, 1, 5) and ARIMA (2, 1, 3) were finally confirmed as the optimal model for confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases, respectively, based on lowest RMSE, MAPE and BIC values. The ARIMA model was also used to identify the COVID-19 trend and showed an increasing pattern on a daily basis in the number of confirmed and recovered cases. In addition, the 60-day forecast showed a steep upward trend in confirmed cases and recovered cases of COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Conclusion: Forecasts show that confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases in Ethiopia will increase on a daily basis for the next 60 days. The findings can be used as a decision-making tool to implement health interventions and reduce the spread of COVID-19 infection.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33907222,"Estimating, monitoring, and forecasting COVID-19 epidemics: a spatiotemporal approach applied to NYC data.",,"We propose a susceptible-exposed-infective-recovered-type (SEIR-type) meta-population model to simulate and monitor the (COVID-19) epidemic evolution. The basic model consists of seven categories, namely, susceptible (S), exposed (E), three infective classes, recovered (R), and deceased (D). We define these categories for n age and sex groups in m different spatial locations. Therefore, the resulting model contains all epidemiological classes for each age group, sex, and location. The mixing between them is accomplished by means of time-dependent infection rate matrices. The model is calibrated with the curve of daily new infections in New York City and its boroughs, including census data, and the proportions of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths for each age range. We finally obtain a model that matches the reported curves and predicts accurate infection information for different locations and age classes.",Epidemic Forecasting
33900932,A COVID-19 Pandemic Artificial Intelligence-Based System With Deep Learning Forecasting and Automatic Statistical Data Acquisition: Development and Implementation Study.,covid-19;artificial intelligence;data visualization;deep learning;machine learning;pandemic;statistical analysis;time series,"BACKGROUND: More than 79.2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1.7 million deaths were caused by SARS-CoV-2; the disease was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Control of the COVID-19 epidemic has become a crucial issue around the globe, but there are limited studies that investigate the global trend of the COVID-19 pandemic together with each country's policy measures. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop an online artificial intelligence (AI) system to analyze the dynamic trend of the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitate forecasting and predictive modeling, and produce a heat map visualization of policy measures in 171 countries. METHODS: The COVID-19 Pandemic AI System (CPAIS) integrated two data sets: the data set from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker from the Blavatnik School of Government, which is maintained by the University of Oxford, and the data set from the COVID-19 Data Repository, which was established by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. This study utilized four statistical and deep learning techniques for forecasting: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), feedforward neural network (FNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and long short-term memory (LSTM). With regard to 1-year records (ie, whole time series data), records from the last 14 days served as the validation set to evaluate the performance of the forecast, whereas earlier records served as the training set. RESULTS: A total of 171 countries that featured in both databases were included in the online system. The CPAIS was developed to explore variations, trends, and forecasts related to the COVID-19 pandemic across several counties. For instance, the number of confirmed monthly cases in the United States reached a local peak in July 2020 and another peak of 6,368,591 in December 2020. A dynamic heat map with policy measures depicts changes in COVID-19 measures for each country. A total of 19 measures were embedded within the three sections presented on the website, and only 4 of the 19 measures were continuous measures related to financial support or investment. Deep learning models were used to enable COVID-19 forecasting; the performances of ARIMA, FNN, and the MLP neural network were not stable because their forecast accuracy was only better than LSTM for a few countries. LSTM demonstrated the best forecast accuracy for Canada, as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were 2272.551, 1501.248, and 0.2723075, respectively. ARIMA (RMSE=317.53169; MAPE=0.4641688) and FNN (RMSE=181.29894; MAPE=0.2708482) demonstrated better performance for South Korea. CONCLUSIONS: The CPAIS collects and summarizes information about the COVID-19 pandemic and offers data visualization and deep learning-based prediction. It might be a useful reference for predicting a serious outbreak or epidemic. Moreover, the system undergoes daily updates and includes the latest information on vaccination, which may change the dynamics of the pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33900929,Age-Stratified Infection Probabilities Combined With a Quarantine-Modified Model for COVID-19 Needs Assessments: Model Development Study.,covid-19;seir;age stratification theory;epidemic modeling;infection probability;mathematical modelling,"BACKGROUND: Classic compartmental models such as the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model all have the weakness of assuming a homogenous population, where everyone has an equal chance of getting infected and dying. Since it was identified in Hubei, China, in December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread around the world and been declared a pandemic. Based on data from Hubei, infection and death distributions vary with age. To control the spread of the disease, various preventive and control measures such as community quarantine and social distancing have been widely used. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to develop a model where age is a factor, considering the study area's age stratification. Additionally, we want to account for the effects of quarantine on the SEIR model. METHODS: We use the age-stratified COVID-19 infection and death distributions from Hubei, China (more than 44,672 infections as of February 11, 2020) as an estimate or proxy for a study area's infection and mortality probabilities for each age group. We then apply these probabilities to the actual age-stratified population of Quezon City, Philippines, to predict infectious individuals and deaths at peak. Testing with different countries shows the predicted number of infectious individuals skewing with the country's median age and age stratification, as expected. We added a Q parameter to the SEIR model to include the effects of quarantine (Q-SEIR). RESULTS: The projections from the age-stratified probabilities give much lower predicted incidences of infection than the Q-SEIR model. As expected, quarantine tends to delay the peaks for both the exposed and infectious groups, and to ""flatten"" the curve or lower the predicted values for each compartment. These two estimates were used as a range to inform the local government's planning and response to the COVID-19 threat. CONCLUSIONS: Age stratification combined with a quarantine-modified model has good qualitative agreement with observations on infections and death rates. That younger populations will have lower death rates due to COVID-19 is a fair expectation for a disease where most fatalities are among older adults.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The timely decisions taken by the government helped in decelerating the spread of COVID-19 to a large extent. Despite these decisions, the pandemic continues to spread. Future predictions about the spread can be helpful for future policy-making, i.e., to plan and control the COVID-19 spread. Further, it is observed throughout the world that asymptomatic corona cases play a major role in the spread of the disease. This motivated us to include such cases for accurate trend prediction. India was chosen for the study as the population and population density is very high for India, resulting in the spread of the disease at high speed. In this paper, the modified SEIRD (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-deceased) model is proposed for predicting the trend and peak of COVID-19 in India and its four worst-affected states. The modified SEIRD model is based on the SEIRD model, which also uses an asymptomatic exposed population that is asymptomatic but infectious for the predictions. Further, a deep learning-based long short-term memory (LSTM) model is also used for trend prediction in this paper. Predictions of LSTM are compared with the predictions obtained from the proposed modified SEIRD model for the next 30 days. The epidemiological data up to 6th September 2020 have been used for carrying out predictions in this paper. Different lockdowns imposed by the Indian government have also been used in modeling and analyzing the proposed modified SEIRD model.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

A new consideration for evaluating and controlling the COVID-19 outbreak will be constructed based on the SEIQR Pandemic Model. In this paper, the real data of COVID-19 spread in Saudi Arabia has been used for the mathematical model and dynamic analyses. Including the new reproductive number and detailed stability analysis, the dynamics of the proposed SEIQR model have been applied. The local sensitivity of the reproduction number has been analyzed. The domain of solution and equilibrium based on the SEIQR model have been proved using a Jacobian linearization process. The state of equilibrium and its significance have been proved, and a study of the integrity of the disease-free equilibrium has been carried out. The Lyapunov stability theorem demonstrated the global stability of the current model equilibrium. The SEIQR model has been numerically validated and projected by contrasting the results from the SEIQR model with the actual COVID-19 spread data in Saudi Arabia. The result of this paper shows that the SEIQR model is a model that is effective in analyzing epidemic spread, such as COVID-19.

Sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the influence of the parameters in curtailing the disease. Using Pontryagin's maximum principle, time-dependent intervention strategies are optimized in order to suppress the transmission of the virus. Numerical simulations are then used to explore various optimal control solutions involving single and multiple controls. Our results suggest that strict intervention effort is required for quick suppression of the disease.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The whole world is facing this threat and trying to stand together to defeat this pandemic. Many countries have defeated this virus by their strong control strategies and many are still trying to do so. To date, some countries have prepared a vaccine against this virus but not in an enough amount. In this research article, we proposed a new SEIRS dynamical model by including the vaccine rate. First we formulate the model with integer order and after that we generalize it in Atangana-Baleanu derivative sense. The high motivation to apply Atangana-Baleanu fractional derivative on our model is to explore the dynamics of the model more clearly. We provide the analysis of the existence of solution for the given fractional SEIRS model. We use the famous Predictor-Corrector algorithm to derive the solution of the model. Also, the analysis for the stability of the given algorithm is established. We simulate number of graphs to see the role of vaccine on the dynamics of the population. For practical simulations, we use the parameter values which are based on real data of Spain.

33898209,Forecasting COVID-19 cases: A comparative analysis between recurrent and convolutional neural networks.,convolutional neural network (cnn);deep learning;long short term memory (lstm);time series analysis,"Though many countries have already launched COVID-19 mass vaccination programs to control the disease outbreak quickly, numerous countries around worldwide are grappling with unprecedented surges of new COVID-19 cases due to a more contagious and deadly variant of coronavirus. As the number of new cases is skyrocketing, pandemic fatigue and public apathy towards different intervention strategies pose new challenges to government officials to combat the pandemic. Henceforth, it is indispensable for the government officials to understand the future dynamics of COVID-19 flawlessly to develop strategic preparedness and resilient response planning. In light of the above circumstances, probable future outbreak scenarios in Brazil, Russia, and the United kingdom have been sketched in this study with the help of four deep learning models: long short term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), convolutional neural network (CNN) and multivariate convolutional neural network (MCNN). In our analysis, the CNN algorithm has outperformed other deep learning models in terms of validation accuracy and forecasting consistency. It is unearthed in our study that CNN can provide robust long-term forecasting results in time-series analysis due to its capability of essential features learning, distortion invariance, and temporal dependence learning. However, the prediction accuracy of the LSTM algorithm has been found to be poor as it tries to discover seasonality and periodic intervals from any time-series dataset, which were absent in our studied countries. Our study has highlighted the promising validation of using convolutional neural networks instead of recurrent neural networks when forecasting with very few features and less amount of historical data.",Epidemic Forecasting

As of 2 August 2020, 129,151 COVID-19 cases were confirmed, including 91,949 recovered cases and 4,867 deaths. After the announcement of lockdown in early April 2020, situation in Iraq was getting steady until late May 2020, when daily COVID-19 infections have raised suddenly due to gradual easing of lockdown restrictions. In this context, it is important to develop a forecasting model to evaluate the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraq and so to guide future health policy. METHODS: COVID-19 lag data were made available by the University of Anbar through their online analytical platform (https://www.uoanbar.edu.iq/covid/), engaged with the day-to-day figures form the Iraqi health authorities. 154 days of patient data were provided covering the period from 2 March 2020 to 2 August 2020. An ensemble of feed-forward neural networks has been adopted to forecast COVID-19 outbreak in Iraq. Also, this study highlights some key questions about this pandemic using data analytics. RESULTS: Forecasting were achieved with accuracy of 87.6% for daily infections, 82.4% for daily recovered cases, and 84.3% for daily deaths. It is anticipated that COVID-19 infections in Iraq will reach about 308,996 cases by the end of September 2020, including 228,551 to recover and 9,477 deaths.

The paper examines the impact of government restrictive measures on the spread and effects of COVID-19. The work is devoted to the improvement of recommendation rules based on novel ensemble of machine learning methods such as regression tree and clustering. The dynamics of migration between countries in clusters, and their relationship with the number of confirmed cases and the percentage of deaths caused by COVID-19, were studied on the example of Poland, Italy and Germany. It is shown that there is a clear relationship between the cluster number and the number of new cases of diseases and death. It has also been shown that different countries' policies to prevent the disease, in particular the timing of restrictive measures, correlate with the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 and the consequences of the disease. For example, the results show a clear proactive tactic of restrictive measures by example of Germany, and catching up on the spread of the disease by example of Italy. A regression tree and guidelines about influence of features on the spreading of COVID-19 and mortality due to this infection have been constructed. The paper predicts the number of deaths due to COVID-19 on a 21-day interval using the obtained guidelines on the example of Sweden. Such forecasting was carried out for two potential government action options: with existing precautionary actions and the same precautionary actions, if they had been taken 20 days earlier (following the example of Germany). The RMSE of the mortality forecast does not exceed 4.2, which shows a good prognostic ability of the developed model. At the same time, the simulation based on the strategy of anticipatory introduction of restrictions gives 2-6% lower values of the forecast of the number of new cases. Thus, the results of this study provide an opportunity to assess the impact of decisions about restrictive measures and predict, simulate the consequences of restrictions policy.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

As the survival time of coronaviruses on surfaces depends on temperature, some researchers have explored the association of daily confirmed cases with environmental factors. Furthermore, some researchers have studied the link between daily fatality rates with regional factors such as health resources, but found no significant factors. As the spreading patterns of COVID-19 development vary a lot among locations, fitting regression models of daily confirmed cases or fatality rates directly with regional factors might not reveal important relationships. In this study, we investigate the link between regional spreading patterns of COVID-19 development in Italy and regional factors in two steps. First, we characterize regional spreading patterns of COVID-19 daily confirmed cases by a special patterned Poisson regression model for longitudinal count; the varying growth and declining patterns as well as turning points among regions in Italy have been well captured by regional regression parameters. We then associate these regional regression parameters with regional factors.

The daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia are shown to be affected by some explanatory variables that are recorded daily: recovered COVID-19 cases, critical cases, daily active cases, tests per million, curfew hours, maximal temperatures, maximal relative humidity, maximal wind speed, and maximal pressure. Restrictions applied by the Saudi Arabia government due to the COVID-19 outbreak, from the suspension of Umrah and flights, and the lockdown of some cities with a curfew are based on information about COVID-15. The aim of the paper is to propose some predictive regression models similar to generalized linear models (GLMs) for fitting COVID-19 data in Saudi Arabia to analyze, forecast, and extract meaningful information that helps decision makers. In this direction, we propose some regression models on the basis of inverted exponential distribution (IE-Reg), Bayesian (BReg) and empirical Bayesian regression (EBReg) models for use in conjunction with inverted exponential distribution (IE-BReg and IE-EBReg). In all approaches, we use the logarithm (log) link function, gamma prior and two loss functions in the Bayesian approach, namely, the zero-one and LINEX loss functions. To deal with the outliers in the proposed models, we apply Huber and Tukey's bisquare (biweight) functions. In addition, we use the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm to estimate Bayesian regression coefficients. Further, we compare IE-Reg, IE-BReg, and IE-EBReg using some criteria, such as Akaike's information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), deviance (D), and mean squared error (MSE). Finally, we apply the collected data of the daily confirmed from March 23 - June 21, 2020 with the corresponding explanatory variables to the theoretical findings.

However, a model-based evaluation of the spatial distribution of these events is lacking. PURPOSE: Our aim was to quantitatively evaluate whether a network diffusion model can explain the spread of small neurologic events. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and LitCovid data bases were searched from January 1, 2020, to July 19, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Thirty-five case series and case studies reported 317 small neurologic events in 123 unique patients with COVID-19. DATA ANALYSIS: Neurologic events were localized to gray or white matter regions of the Illinois Institute of Technology (gray-matter and white matter) Human Brain Atlas using radiologic images and descriptions. The total proportion of events was calculated for each region. A network diffusion model was implemented, and any brain regions showing a significant association (P < .05, family-wise error-corrected) between predicted and measured events were considered epicenters. DATA SYNTHESIS: Within gray matter, neurologic events were widely distributed, with the largest number of events ( approximately 10%) observed in the bilateral superior temporal, precentral, and lateral occipital cortices, respectively. Network diffusion modeling showed a significant association between predicted and measured gray matter events when the spread of pathology was seeded from the bilateral cerebellum (r = 0.51, P < .001, corrected) and putamen (r = 0.4, P = .02, corrected). In white matter, most events ( approximately 26%) were observed within the bilateral corticospinal tracts. LIMITATIONS: The risk of bias was not considered because all studies were either case series or case studies. CONCLUSIONS: Transconnectome diffusion of pathology via the structural network of the brain may contribute to the spread of neurologic events in patients with COVID-19.",Epidemic Forecasting

As long as effective medical treatment and vaccination are not available, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, self-isolation and quarantine as well as far-reaching shutdowns of economic activity and public life are the only available strategies to prevent the virus from spreading. These interventions must meet conflicting requirements where some objectives, like the minimization of disease-related deaths or the impact on health systems, demand for stronger counter-measures, while others, such as social and economic costs, call for weaker counter-measures. Therefore, finding the optimal compromise of counter-measures requires the solution of a multi-objective optimization problem that is based on accurate prediction of future infection spreading for all combinations of counter-measures under consideration. We present a strategy for construction and solution of such a multi-objective optimization problem with real-world applicability. The strategy is based on a micro-model allowing for accurate prediction via a realistic combination of person-centric data-driven human mobility and behavior, stochastic infection models and disease progression models including micro-level inclusion of governmental intervention strategies. For this micro-model, a surrogate macro-model is constructed and validated that is much less computationally expensive and can therefore be used in the core of a numerical solver for the multi-objective optimization problem. The resulting set of optimal compromises between counter-measures (Pareto front) is discussed and its meaning for policy decisions is outlined.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Their computational cost though is very high and for stochastic ABMs a lot of individual simulations are required to sample quantities of interest. Especially, large numbers of agents render the sampling infeasible. Model reduction to a metapopulation model leads to a significant gain in computational efficiency, while preserving important dynamical properties. Based on a precise mathematical description of spatio-temporal ABMs, we present two different metapopulation approaches (stochastic and piecewise deterministic) and discuss the approximation steps between the different models within this framework. Especially, we show how the stochastic metapopulation model results from a Galerkin projection of the underlying ABM onto a finite-dimensional ansatz space. Finally, we utilize our modeling framework to provide a conceptual model for the spreading of COVID-19 that can be scaled to real-world scenarios.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33884941,Quasi-Simpson paradox in estimating the expected mortality rate from the SARS-CoV-2.,sars-cov-2;simpson's paradox;asymptomatic,"On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared SARS-CoV-2 a global pandemic, based on a high infection rate and a high case fatality rate (CFR). The combination of these two points led WHO to forecast a high expected mortality rate of approximately 2% of the population. The phenomenon of Simpson's paradox teaches us that we should be careful when we combine two variables together. Indeed, despite the high mortality rate in several places, this forecast seems to have collapsed. We believe one of the reasons for the erroneous forecasts is that combining the above points ignored a confounding variable - many of the virus carriers are asymptomatic and therefore not diagnosed.",Epidemic Forecasting
33882085,The first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Tuscany (Italy): A SI2R2D compartmental model with uncertainty evaluation.,,"With the aim of studying the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Tuscany region of Italy during the first epidemic wave (February-June 2020), we define a compartmental model that accounts for both detected and undetected infections and assumes that only notified cases can die. We estimate the infection fatality rate, the case fatality rate, and the basic reproduction number, modeled as a time-varying function, by calibrating on the cumulative daily number of observed deaths and notified infected, after fixing to plausible values the other model parameters to assure identifiability. The confidence intervals are estimated by a parametric bootstrap procedure and a Global Sensitivity Analysis is performed to assess the sensitivity of the estimates to changes in the values of the fixed parameters. According to our results, the basic reproduction number drops from an initial value of 6.055 to 0 at the end of the national lockdown, then it grows again, but remaining under 1. At the beginning of the epidemic, the case and the infection fatality rates are estimated to be 13.1% and 2.3%, respectively. Among the parameters considered as fixed, the average time from infection to recovery for the not notified infected appears to be the most impacting one on the model estimates. The probability for an infected to be notified has a relevant impact on the infection fatality rate and on the shape of the epidemic curve. This stresses the need of collecting information on these parameters to better understand the phenomenon and get reliable predictions.",Epidemic Forecasting
33882054,Population density and basic reproductive number of COVID-19 across United States counties.,,"The basic reproductive number (R0) is a function of contact rates among individuals, transmission probability, and duration of infectiousness. We sought to determine the association between population density and R0 of SARS-CoV-2 across U.S. counties. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using linear mixed models with random intercept and fixed slopes to assess the association of population density and R0, and controlled for state-level effects using random intercepts. We also assessed whether the association was differential across county-level main mode of transportation percentage as a proxy for transportation accessibility, and adjusted for median household income. The median R0 among the United States counties was 1.66 (IQR: 1.35-2.11). A population density threshold of 22 people/km2 was needed to sustain an outbreak. Counties with greater population density have greater rates of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, likely due to increased contact rates in areas with greater density. An increase in one unit of log population density increased R0 by 0.16 (95% CI: 0.13 to 0.19). This association remained when adjusted for main mode of transportation and household income. The effect of population density on R0 was not modified by transportation mode. Our findings suggest that dense areas increase contact rates necessary for disease transmission. SARS-CoV-2 R0 estimates need to consider this geographic variability for proper planning and resource allocation, particularly as epidemics newly emerge and old outbreaks resurge.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Therefore, it is important to keep track the number of patients being affected. The current system gives the computerized data in a collective way which is very difficult to analyze and predict the growth of disease in a particular area and in the world. Machine learning algorithms can be used to successfully map the disease and its progression to solve this problem. Machine Learning, a branch of computer science, is critical in correctly distinguishing patients with the condition by analyzing their chest X-ray photographs. Supervised Machine learning models with associated algorithms (like LR, SVR and Time series algorithms) to analyze data for regression and classification helps in training the model to predict the number of total number of global confirmed cases who will be prone to the disease in the upcoming days. In this proposed work, the overall dataset of the world is being collected, preprocessed and the number of confirmed cases up to a particular date are extracted which is given as the training set to the model. The model is being trained by supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the growth of cases in the upcoming days.

Since the undetected cases are not quarantined, they can be expected to transmit the infection at a much higher rate than their quarantined counterparts. That is, in the absence of extensive random testing, the actual prevalence and incidence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection can be significantly higher than that being reported. Thus, it is imperative that the information on the percentage of undetected (or unreported) cases be incorporated in the mechanism for estimating the key epidemiological parameters, like rate of transmission, rate of recovery, reproduction rate, etc., and hence, for forecasting the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. In this paper, we have developed a new dynamic version of the basic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental model, called the susceptible-infected (quarantined/ free) - recovered- deceased [SI(Q/F)RD] model, to assimilate the impact of the time-varying proportion of undetected cases on the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. Further, we have presented a Dirichlet-Beta state-space formulation of the SI(Q/F)RD model for the estimation of its parameters using posterior realizations from the Gibbs sampling procedure. As a demonstration, the proposed methodology has been implemented to forecast the COVID-19 transmission in California and Florida. Results suggest significant amount of underreporting of cases in both states. Further, posterior estimates obtained from the state-space SI(Q/F)RD model show that average reproduction numbers associated with the undetected infectives [California: 1.464; Florida: 1.612] are substantially higher than those associated with the quarantined infectives [California: 0.497; Florida: 0.359]. The long-term forecasts of death counts show trends similar to those of the estimates of excess deaths for the comparison period post training data timeline.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Given the importance to assess the evolution and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and to forecast the next scenario of the pandemic, mainly in countries with limited healthcare systems, we estimated the reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), India, and a possible scenario for this pandemic in the region. Subject and methods: We estimated the reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 in its first outbreak stage in the northwestern region of Himalaya, India, and we also predicted new daily cases for the next 90 days using different R0, testing a plausible end of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Results: Our results showed a considerable increase in the number of cases, but with a tendency to asymptote. Anantnag, Bandipora, Baramulla, Shopian, and Srinagar districts showed more than 100 cases and Kulgam and Kathua districts showed strong growth of the number of cases from the beginning of May, without a tendency to normalization. The estimated R0 for the J&K region was 1.041; but by decreasing the RO by 10, 25, and 50%, we observed a great decrease in the daily number of new cases, especially by decreasing by 50%. Conclusion: In this study, we indicate positive effects of the preventive measures, such as lockdown and social distancing, taken in the J&K region, showing a stabilization of the growth curves of new cases of SARS-CoV-2, which tends to a strong decrease over time as the R0 decreases.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

To enhance the prediction capabilities of the models, properties of the unknown uncertainties in the pandemic disease, which can be utterly random, or function of the system dynamics, or it can be correlated with an unknown function, should be determined. The known structures and amount of the uncertainties can also help the state authorities to improve the policies based on the recognized source of the uncertainties. For instance, the uncertainties correlated with an unknown function imply existence of an undetected factor in the casualties. In this paper, we extend the SpID-N (Suspicious-Infected-Death with non-pharmacological policies) model as in the form of MIMO (Multi-Input-Multi-Output) structure by adding the multi-dimensional unknown uncertainties. The results confirm that the infected and death sub-models mostly have random uncertainties (due undetected casualties) whereas the suspicious sub-model has uncertainties correlated with the internal dynamics (governmental policy of increasing the number of the daily tests) for Turkey. However, since the developed MIMO model parameters are learned from the data (daily reported casualties), it can be easily adapted for other countries. Obtained model with the corresponding uncertainties predicts a distinctive second peak where the number of deaths, infected and suspicious casualties disappear in 240, 290, and more than 300 days, respectively, for Turkey.",Epidemic Forecasting
33878136,Estimating COVID-19 cases in Makkah region of Saudi Arabia: Space-time ARIMA modeling.,,"The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is spreading across the globe. By 30 Sep 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the number of cases worldwide had reached 34 million with more than one million deaths. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) registered the first case of COVID-19 on 2 Mar 2020. Since then, the number of infections has been increasing gradually on a daily basis. On 20 Sep 2020, the KSA reported 334,605 cases, with 319,154 recoveries and 4,768 deaths. The KSA has taken several measures to control the spread of COVID-19, especially during the Umrah and Hajj events of 1441, including stopping Umrah and performing this year's Hajj in reduced numbers from within the Kingdom, and imposing a curfew on the cities of the Kingdom from 23 Mar to 28 May 2020. In this article, two statistical models were used to measure the impact of the curfew on the spread of COVID-19 in KSA. The two models are Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and Spatial Time-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (STARIMA) model. We used the data obtained from 31 May to 11 October 2020 to assess the model of STARIMA for the COVID-19 confirmation cases in (Makkah, Jeddah, and Taif) in KSA. The results show that STARIMA models are more reliable in forecasting future epidemics of COVID-19 than ARIMA models.

Since the first case was recorded on December 29, 2019, in Wuhan of China, the disease has rapidly extended to other nations of the world to claim many lives, especially in the USA, the United Kingdom, and Western Europe. To stay ahead of the curve consequent of the continued increase in case and mortality, predictive tools are needed to guide adequate response. Therefore, this study aims to determine the best predictive models and investigate the impact of lockdown policy on the USA' COVID-19 incidence and mortality. This study focuses on the statistical modelling of the USA daily COVID-19 incidence and mortality cases based on some intuitive properties of the data such as overdispersion and autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity. The impact of the lockdown policy on cases and mortality was assessed by comparing the USA incidence case with that of Sweden where there is no strict lockdown. Stochastic models based on negative binomial autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity [NB INGARCH (p,q)], the negative binomial regression, the autoregressive integrated moving average model with exogenous variables (ARIMAX) and without exogenous variables (ARIMA) models of several orders are presented, to identify the best fitting model for the USA daily incidence cases. The performance of the optimal NB INGARCH model on daily incidence cases was compared with the optimal ARIMA model in terms of their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). Also, the NB model, ARIMA model and without exogenous variables are formulated for USA daily COVID-19 death cases. It was observed that the incidence and mortality cases show statistically significant increasing trends over the study period. The USA daily COVID-19 incidence is autocorrelated, linear and contains a structural break but exhibits autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity. Observed data are compared with the fitted data from the optimal models. The results further indicate that the NB INGARCH fits the observed incidence better than ARIMA while the NB models perform better than the optimal ARIMA and ARIMAX models for death counts in terms of AIC and root mean square error (RMSE). The results show a statistically significant relationship between the lockdown policy in the USA and incidence and death counts. This suggests the efficacy of the lockdown policy in the USA.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Critical issues include the rate at which the coronavirus spreads and the effect of quarantine measures and population vaccination on this rate. Knowledge of the laws of the spread of COVID-19 will enable assessment of the effectiveness and reasonableness of the quarantine measures used, as well as determination of the necessary level of vaccination needed to overcome this crisis. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to establish the laws of the spread of COVID-19 and to use them to develop a mathematical model to predict changes in the number of active cases over time, possible human losses, and the rate of recovery of patients, to make informed decisions about the number of necessary beds in hospitals, the introduction and type of quarantine measures, and the required threshold of vaccination of the population. METHODS: This study analyzed the onset of COVID-19 spread in countries such as China, Italy, Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, and Germany based on publicly available statistical data. The change in the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recovered persons over time was examined, considering the possible introduction of quarantine measures and isolation of infected people in these countries. Based on the data, the virus transmissibility and the average duration of the disease at different stages were evaluated, and a model based on the principle of recursion was developed. Its key features are the separation of active (nonisolated) infected persons into a distinct category and the prediction of their number based on the average duration of the disease in the inactive phase and the concentration of these persons in the population in the preceding days. RESULTS: Specific values for SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and COVID-19 duration were estimated for different countries. In China, the viral transmissibility was 3.12 before quarantine measures were implemented and 0.36 after these measures were lifted. For the other countries, the viral transmissibility was 2.28-2.76 initially, and it then decreased to 0.87-1.29 as a result of quarantine measures. Therefore, it can be expected that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 will be suppressed if 56%-64% of the total population becomes vaccinated or survives COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted in most countries are too weak compared to those previously used in China. Therefore, it is not expected that the spread of COVID-19 will stop and the disease will cease to exist naturally or owing to quarantine measures. Active vaccination of the population is needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, the required specific percentage of vaccinated individuals depends on the magnitude of viral transmissibility, which can be evaluated using the proposed model and statistical data for the country of interest.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Most efforts follow variants of the established SIR methodological framework that divides a population into ""Susceptible"", ""Infectious"" and ""Recovered/Removed"" fractions and defines their dynamic inter-relationships with first-order differential equations. Goal: This paper proposes a novel approach based on data-guided detection and concatenation of infection waves - each of them described by a Riccati equation with adaptively estimated parameters. Methods: This approach was applied to Covid-19 daily time-series data of US confirmed cases, resulting in the decomposition of the epidemic time-course into five ""Riccati modules"" representing major infection waves to date (June 18th). Results: Four waves have passed the time-point of peak infection rate, with the fifth expected to peak on July 20th. The obtained parameter estimates indicate gradual reduction of infectivity rate, although the latest wave is expected to be the largest. Conclusions: This analysis suggests that, if no new waves of infection emerge, the Covid-19 epidemic will be controlled in the US (<5000 new daily cases) by September 26th, and the maximum of confirmed cases will reach 4,160,000. Importantly, this approach can be used to detect (via rigorous statistical methods) the emergence of possible new waves of infections in the future.

This nonlinear model for the COVID-19 epidemic includes eight state variables (susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, hospitalized, recovered, deceased, and insusceptible populations). Two plausible scenarios are put forward in this article to control this epidemic before and after its vaccine invention. In the first scenario, the social distancing and hospitalization rates are employed as two applicable control inputs to diminish the exposed and infected groups. However, in the second scenario after the vaccine development, the vaccination rate is taken into account as the third control input to reduce the susceptible populations, in addition to the two objectives of the first scenario. The proposed feedback control measures are defined in terms of the hospitalized and deceased populations due to the available statistical data, while other unmeasurable compartmental variables are estimated by an extended Kalman filter (EKF). In other words, the susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, recovered, and insusceptible individuals cannot be identified precisely because of the asymptomatic infection of COVID-19 in some cases, its incubation period, and the lack of an adequate community screening. Utilizing the Lyapunov theorem, the stability and bounded tracking convergence of the closed-loop epidemiological system are investigated in the presence of modeling uncertainties. Finally, a comprehensive simulation study is conducted based on Canada's reported cases for two defined timing plans (with different treatment rates). Obtained results demonstrate that the developed EKF-based control scheme can achieve desired epidemic goals (exponential decrease of infected, exposed, and susceptible people).",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

To disrupt the widespread of COVID-19, a mechanism for social distancing is indispensable. Also, to predict the effectiveness and quantity of social distancing for a particular social network, with a certain contagion, a generalized model is needed. In this manuscript, we propose a social distancing mediated generalized model to predict the pandemic spread of COVID-19. By considering growth rate as a temporal harmonic function damped with social distancing in generalized Richard model and by using the data of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, USA and India, we find that, with time, the cumulative spread grows more rapidly due to weak social distancing as compared to the stronger social distancing, where it is explicitly decreasing. Furthermore, we predict the possible outcomes with various social distancing scenarios by considering highest growth rate as an initial state, and illustrate that the increase in social distancing tremendously decreases growth rate, even it tends to reach zero in lockdown regimes. Our findings not only provide epidemic growth scenarios as a function of social distancing but also provide a modified growth model to predict controlled information flow in any network.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In this study, we conduct a scenario analysis for COVID-19 in Malaysia using a simple universality class of the SIR system and extensions thereof (i.e., the inclusion of temporary immunity through the reinfection problems and limited medical resources scenarios leads to the SIRS-type model). This system has been employed in order to provide further insights on the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 pandemic. As a case study, the COVID-19 transmission dynamics are investigated using daily confirmed cases in Malaysia, where some of the epidemiological parameters of this system are estimated based on the fitting of the model to real COVID-19 data released by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH). We observe that this model is able to mimic the trend of infection trajectories of COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia and it is possible for transmission dynamics to be influenced by the reinfection force and limited medical resources problems. A rebound effect in transmission could occur after several years and this situation depends on the intensity of reinfection force. Our analysis also depicts the existence of a critical value in reinfection threshold beyond which the infection dynamics persist and the COVID-19 outbreaks are rather hard to eradicate.

METHODS: This study aims to present a spatiotemporal epidemic model based on spatially stratified heterogeneity (SSH) to simulate the epidemic spread. A susceptible-exposed/latent-infected-removed (SEIR) model was constructed for each SSH-identified stratum (each administrative city) to estimate the spatiotemporal epidemiological parameters of the outbreak. RESULTS: We estimated that the mean latent and removed periods were 5.40 and 2.13 days, respectively. There was an average of 1.72 latent or infected persons per 10,000 Wuhan travelers to other locations until January 20th, 2020. The space-time basic reproduction number (R0) estimates indicate an initial value between 2 and 3.5 in most cities on this date. The mean period for R0 estimates to decrease to 80%, and 50% of initial values in cities were an average of 14.73 and 19.62 days, respectively.

In India, the outbreak, starts on 2(nd) March, 2020 and after that the cases are increasing exponentially. Very high population density, the unavailability of specific medicines or vaccines, insufficient evidences regarding the transmission mechanism of the disease also make it more difficult to fight against the disease properly in India. Mathematical models have been used to predict the disease dynamics and also to assess the efficiency of the intervention strategies in reducing the disease burden. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to describe the disease transmission mechanism between the individuals. Our proposed model is fitted to the daily new reported cases in India during the period 2(nd) March, 2020 to 12(th) November, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number, effective reproduction number and epidemic doubling time from the incidence data for the above-mentioned period. We further assess the effect of implementing preventive measures in reducing the new cases. Our model projects the daily new COVID-19 cases in India during 13(th) November, 2020 to 25(th) February, 2021 for a range of intervention strength. We also investigate that higher intervention effort is required to control the disease outbreak within a shorter period of time in India. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the strength of the intervention should be increased over the time to eradicate the disease effectively.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Valid near-term projections of cases are required to inform the escalation, maintenance and de-escalation of public health measures, and for short-term health care resource planning. METHODS: Near-term case and epidemic growth rate projections for Canada were estimated using three phenomenological models: the logistic model, Generalized Richard's model (GRM) and a modified Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (m-IDEA) model. Throughout the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada, these models have been validated against official national epidemiological data on an ongoing basis. RESULTS: The best-fit models estimated that the number of COVID-19 cases predicted to be reported in Canada as of April 1, 2020 and May 1, 2020 would be 11,156 (90 % prediction interval: 9,156-13,905) and 54,745 (90 % prediction interval: 54,252-55,239). The three models varied in their projections and their performance over the first seven weeks of their implementation. Both the logistic model and GRM under-predicted cases reported a week following the projection date in nearly all instances. The logistic model performed best at the early stages, the m-IDEA model performed best at the later stages, and the GRM performed most consistently during the full period assessed. CONCLUSIONS: All three models have yielded qualitatively comparable near-term forecasts of cases and epidemic growth for Canada. Under or over-estimation of projected cases and epidemic growth by these models could be associated with changes in testing policies and/or public health measures. Simple forecasting models can be invaluable in projecting the changes in trajectory of subsequent waves of cases to provide timely information to support the pandemic response.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33857499,Estimating and mitigating the risk of COVID-19 epidemic rebound associated with reopening of international borders in Vietnam: a modelling study.,,"BACKGROUND: Vietnam has emerged as one of the world's leading success stories in responding to COVID-19. After a prolonged period of little to no transmission, there was an outbreak of unknown source in July, 2020, in the Da Nang region, but the outbreak was quickly suppressed. We aimed to use epidemiological, behavioural, demographic, and policy data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang to calibrate an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission for Vietnam, and to estimate the risk of future outbreaks associated with reopening of international borders in the country. METHODS: For this modelling study, we used comprehensive data from June 15 to Oct 15, 2020, on testing, COVID-19 cases, and quarantine breaches within an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to model a COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang in July, 2020. We applied this model to quantify the risk of future outbreaks in Vietnam in the 3 months after the reopening of international borders, under different behavioural scenarios, policy responses (ie, closure of workplaces and schools), and ongoing testing. FINDINGS: We estimated that the outbreak in Da Nang between July and August, 2020, resulted in substantial community transmission, and that higher levels of symptomatic testing could have mitigated this transmission. We estimated that the outbreak peaked on Aug 2, 2020, with an estimated 1060 active infections (95% projection interval 890-1280). If the population of Vietnam remains highly compliant with mask-wearing policies, our projections indicate that the epidemic would remain under control even if a small but steady flow of imported infections escaped quarantine into the community. However, if complacency increases and testing rates are relatively low (10% of symptomatic individuals are tested), the epidemic could rebound again, resulting in an estimated 2100 infections (95% projected interval 1050-3610) in 3 months. These outcomes could be mitigated if the behaviour of the general population responds dynamically to increases in locally acquired cases that exceed specific thresholds, but only if testing of symptomatic individuals is also increased. INTERPRETATION: The successful response to COVID-19 in Vietnam could be improved even further with higher levels of symptomatic testing. If the previous approaches are used in response to new COVID-19 outbreaks, epidemic control is possible even in the presence of low levels of imported cases.

33854165,"Data suggest COVID-19 affected numbers greatly exceeded detected numbers, in four European countries, as per a delayed SEIQR model.",,"People in many countries are now infected with COVID-19. By now, it is clear that the number of people infected is much greater than the number of reported cases. To estimate the infected but undetected/unreported cases using a mathematical model, we can use a parameter called the probability of quarantining an infected individual. This parameter exists in the time-delayed SEIQR model (Scientific Reports, article number: 3505). Here, two limiting cases of a network of such models are used to estimate the undetected population. The first limit corresponds to the network collapsing onto a single node and is referred to as the mean-[Formula: see text] model. In the second case, the number of nodes in the network is infinite and results in a continuum model wherein the infectivity is statistically distributed. We use a generalized Pareto distribution to model the infectivity. This distribution has a fat tail and models the presence of super-spreaders that contribute to the disease progression. While both models capture the detected numbers well, the predictions of affected numbers from the continuum model are more realistic. Our results suggest that affected people outnumber detected people by one to two orders of magnitude in Spain, the UK, Italy, and Germany. Our results are consistent with corresponding trends obtained from published serological studies in Spain, the UK and Italy. The match with limited studies in Germany is poor, possibly because Germany's partial lockdown approach requires different modeling.",Epidemic Forecasting
33854079,A compartmental model that predicts the effect of social distancing and vaccination on controlling COVID-19.,,"The understanding of the interaction between disease dynamics and human behavior is an important and essential point to control infectious. Disease outbreak can be influenced by social distancing and vaccination. In this study, we introduce two compartmental models to derive the epidemic curve and analyze the individual's behavior in spreading and controlling the COVID-19 epidemic. The first model includes Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Hospitalized, Recovered and Death compartments and in the second model, we added a new compartment namely, semi-susceptible individuals that are assumed to be more immune than the susceptible. A comparison of the two models shows that the second model provides a better fit to the daily infected cases from Egypt, Belgium, Japan, Nigeria, Italy, and Germany released by WHO. Finally, we added a vaccinated term to the model to predict how vaccination could control the epidemic. The model was applied on the record data from WHO.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Treatment
33849258,"Systems dynamics approach for modelling South Africa's response to COVID-19: A ""what if"" scenario.",,"BACKGROUND: Many countries in the world are still struggling to control COVID-19 pandemic. As of April 28, 2020, South Africa reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Sub-Sahara Africa. The country took aggressive steps to control the spread of the virus including setting a national command team for COVID-19 and putting the country on a complete lockdown for more than 100 days. Evidence across most countries has shown that, it is vital to monitor the progression of pandemics and assess the effects of various public health measures, such as lockdowns. Countries need to have scientific tools to assist in monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of mitigation interventions. The objective of this study was thus to assess the extent to which a systems dynamics model can forecast COVID-19 infections in South Africa and be a useful tool in evaluating government interventions to manage the epidemic through 'what if' simulations. DESIGN AND METHODS: This study presents a systems dynamics model (SD) of the COVID-19 infection in South Africa, as one of such tools. The development of the SD model in this study is grounded in design science research which fundamentally builds on prior research of modelling complex systems. RESULTS: The SD model satisfactorily replicates the general trend of COVID-19 infections and recovery for South Africa within the first 100 days of the pandemic. The model further confirms that the decision to lockdown the country was a right one, otherwise the country's health capacity would have been overwhelmed. Going forward, the model predicts that the level of infection in the country will peak towards the last quarter of 2020, and thereafter start to decline. Conclusions: Ultimately, the model structure and simulations suggest that a systems dynamics model can be a useful tool in monitoring, predicting and testing interventions to manage COVID-19 with an acceptable margin of error. Moreover, the model can be developed further to include more variables as more facts on the COVID-19 emerge.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33849254,Dynamic estimation of epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 outbreak and effects of interventions on its spread.,,"BACKGROUND: A key challenge in estimating epidemiological parameters for a pandemic such as the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan is the discrepancy between the officially reported number of infections and the true number of infections. A common approach to tackling the challenge is to use the number of infections exported from the originating city to infer the true number. This approach can only provide a static estimate of the epidemiological parameters before city lockdown because there are almost no exported cases thereafter. METHODS: We propose a Bayesian estimation method that dynamically estimates the epidemiological parameters by recovering true numbers of infections from day-to-day official numbers. To illustrate the use of this method, we provide a comprehensive retrospection on how the COVID-19 had progressed in Wuhan from January 19 to March 5, 2020. Particularly, we estimate that the outbreak sizes by January 23 and March 5 were 11,239 [95% CI 4,794-22,372] and 124,506 [95% CI 69,526-265,113], respectively. RESULTS: The effective reproduction number attained its maximum on January 24 (3.42 [95% CI 3.34-3.50]) and became less than 1 from February 7 (0.76 [95% CI 0.65-0.92]). We also estimate the effects of two major government interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan. CONCLUSIONS: This case study by our proposed method affirms the believed importance and effectiveness of imposing tight non-essential travel restrictions and affirm the importance and effectiveness of government interventions (e.g., transportation suspension and large scale hospitalization) for effective mitigation of COVID-19 community spread.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the prediction of future daily national confirmed COVID-19 infection growth-the percentage change in total cumulative cases-across 14 days for 114 countries using nonpharmaceutical intervention metrics and cultural dimension metrics, which are indicative of specific national sociocultural norms. METHODS: We combined the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker data set, Hofstede cultural dimensions, and daily reported COVID-19 infection case numbers to train and evaluate five non-time series machine learning models in predicting confirmed infection growth. We used three validation methods-in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and country-based cross-validation-for the evaluation, each of which was applicable to a different use case of the models. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate high R(2) values between the labels and predictions for the in-distribution method (0.959) and moderate R(2) values for the out-of-distribution and country-based cross-validation methods (0.513 and 0.574, respectively) using random forest and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) regression. Although these models may be used to predict confirmed infection growth, the differing accuracies obtained from the three tasks suggest a strong influence of the use case. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides new considerations in using machine learning techniques with nonpharmaceutical interventions and cultural dimensions as metrics to predict the national growth of confirmed COVID-19 infections.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Still, the human response to restrain the virus is also creating massive ripples through different systems, such as health, economy, education, and tourism. This paper focuses on research and applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to predict COVID-19 propagation using the available time-series data and study the effect of the quality of life, the number of tests performed, and the awareness of citizens on the virus in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries at the Gulf area. So we focused on cases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), United Arab of Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and Qatar. For this aim, we accessed the time-series real-datasets collected from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). The timeline of our data is from January 22, 2020 to January 25, 2021. We have implemented the proposed model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with ten hidden units (neurons) to predict COVID-19 confirmed and death cases. From the experimental results, we confirmed that KSA and Qatar would take the most extended period to recover from the COVID-19 virus, and the situation will be controllable in the second half of March 2021 in UAE, Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain. Also, we calculated the root mean square error (RMSE) between the actual and predicted values of each country for confirmed and death cases, and we found that the best values for both confirmed and death cases are 320.79 and 1.84, respectively, and both are related to Bahrain. While the worst values are 1768.35 and 21.78, respectively, and both are related to KSA. On the other hand, we also calculated the mean absolute relative errors (MARE) between the actual and predicted values of each country for confirmed and death cases, and we found that the best values for both confirmed and deaths cases are 37.76 and 0.30, and these are related to Kuwait and Qatar respectively.

33842186,Modeling of COVID-19 with limited public health resources: a comparative study of three most affected countries.,,"COVID-19 has become a deadly pandemic in the recent times claiming millions of lives worldwide in a grievous manner. Most of the countries in the world have limited number of medical resources (hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc.), and in the case of large outbreak, it becomes very difficult to provide treatment to every infected individual. In this study, we propound a mathematical model where we classify the infected into two subcategories-asymptomatic and symptomatic. This model further accounts for the effect of limited medical resource for infected people and using face masks in combating the pandemic. Focusing on these aspects, we analyze the model and exploit the available data for assessing the pattern in three most affected countries, namely USA, India and Brazil. The developed model is calibrated to fit data for these three countries and estimate the transmission rate of symptomatic, asymptomatic individuals. The rate at which the individuals who are quarantined recover is estimated as well. Along with these estimations, a comparative study based on the basic reproduction number estimated for the three countries is presented. Standard methods of sensitivity analysis are performed to analyze the ways in which basic reproduction number is impacted upon due to changes in different parameters of the model. Further, we obtain disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium of the model. It is observed that backward bifurcation occurs if the capacity of treatment is small and bistable equilibria are shown that makes the system more sensitive to the initial conditions. Sufficient conditions for the local asymptomatic stability of the endemic equilibrium and disease-free equilibrium of the system are obtained. The results of this study imply that to curb the severity of the increasing cases of the disease in these countries, effective strategies to control disease spread should be implemented so that the basic reproduction number can be decreased below the threshold value which is certainly less than unity. The use of protective masks in public is shown to be an important preventive measure to lower disease transmission rate. Also, the quantity of medical resources should increase so that every infected person can get better treatment.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Governments and legislative bodies rely on insights from prediction models to suggest new policies and to assess the effectiveness of enforced policies. Therefore, access to accurate outbreak prediction models is essential to obtain insights into the likely spread and consequences of infectious diseases. The objective of this study is to predict the future COVID-19 situation of Korea. Here, we employed 5 models for this analysis; SEIR, local linear regression (LLR), negative binomial (NB) regression, segment Poisson, deep-learning based long short-term memory models (LSTM) and tree based gradient boosting machine (GBM). After prediction, model performance comparison was evelauated using relative mean squared errors (RMSE) for two sets of train (January 20, 2020December 31, 2020 and January 20, 2020January 31, 2021) and testing data (January 1, 2021February 28, 2021 and February 1, 2021February 28, 2021) . Except for segmented Poisson model, the other models predicted a decline in the daily confirmed cases in the country for the coming future. RMSE values' comparison showed that LLR, GBM, SEIR, NB, and LSTM respectively, performed well in the forecasting of the pandemic situation of the country.

In March 2020, more than 300,000 cases have been reported all over Iraq. This study aims to represent data analysis, modelling and forecasting approaches to the presented data in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. METHODOLOGY: The project involves mathematical models for forecasting and artificial simulations using particles.

A series of simulations have been conducted to observe the possibilities of virus spread rates in a virtual world which represents a quarter of Erbil. RESULTS: The outcome of the study shows how the disease have spread in Kurdistan, and what are the current rates to compare with neighbour regions. The modelling clearly shows that with cases still sporadically appearing, the risk of second and third waves of infections is high. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the regional government must reduce unnecessary gatherings to the lowest possible level.

We aimed to estimate in near real time the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this modelling study, we developed a method to reconstruct the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of infections being detected, using the joint analysis of age-stratified seroprevalence, hospitalisation, and case data, with deconvolution methods. We developed our method on a dataset consisting of seroprevalence estimates from 9782 participants (aged >/=20 years) in the two worst affected regions of France in May, 2020, and applied our approach to the 13 French metropolitan regions over the period March, 2020, to January, 2021. We validated our method externally using data from a national seroprevalence study done between May and June, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimate that 5.7% (95% CI 5.1-6.4) of adults in metropolitan France had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by May 11, 2020. This proportion remained stable until August, 2020, and increased to 14.9% (13.2-16.9) by Jan 15, 2021. With 26.5% (23.4-29.8) of adult residents having been infected in Ile-de-France (Paris region) compared with 5.1% (4.5-5.8) in Brittany by January, 2021, regional variations remained large (coefficient of variation [CV] 0.50) although less so than in May, 2020 (CV 0.74). The proportion infected was twice as high (20.4%, 15.6-26.3) in 20-49-year-olds than in individuals aged 50 years or older (9.7%, 6.9-14.1). 40.2% (34.3-46.3) of infections in adults were detected in June to August, 2020, compared with 49.3% (42.9-55.9) in November, 2020, to January, 2021. Our regional estimates of seroprevalence were strongly correlated with the external validation dataset (coefficient of correlation 0.89). INTERPRETATION: Our simple approach to estimate the proportion of adults that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 can help to characterise the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, epidemic dynamics, and the performance of surveillance in different regions.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have proved their capability in time series forecasting non-linear problems. In the present study, the relationship between weather factor and COVID-19 cases was assessed, and also developed a forecasting model using long short-term memory (LSTM), a deep learning model. The study found that the specific humidity has a strong positive correlation, whereas there is a negative correlation with maximum temperature, and a positive correlation with minimum temperature was observed in various geographic locations of India. The weather data and COVID-19 confirmed case data (1 April to 30 June 2020) were used to optimize univariate and multivariate LSTM time series forecast models. The optimized models were utilized to forecast the daily COVID-19 cases for the period 1 July 2020 to 31 July 2020 with 1 to 14 days of lead time. The results showed that the univariate LSTM model was reasonably good for the short-term (1 day lead) forecast of COVID-19 cases (relative error <20%). Moreover, the multivariate LSTM model improved the medium-range forecast skill (1-7 days lead) after including the weather factors. The study observed that the specific humidity played a crucial role in improving the forecast skill majorly in the West and northwest region of India. Similarly, the temperature played a significant role in model enhancement in the Southern and Eastern regions of India.",Epidemic Forecasting
33836034,"SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in Denmark, February through October 2020: Nature of the past epidemic and how it may develop in the future.",,"BACKGROUND: Initially, the relative sizes of the asymptomatic and the symptomatic infected populations were not known for the COVID-19 pandemic and neither was the actual fatality rate. Therefore it was not clear either how the pandemic would impact the healthcare system. As a result it was initially predicted that the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark would overwhelm the healthcare system and thus both the diagnosis and treatment of other hospital patients were compromised for an extended period. AIM: To develop a mathematical model, which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infected persons, for early estimation of the epidemic's course, its Infection Fatality Rate and the healthcare system load in Denmark, both retrospectively and prospectively. METHODS: The SEIRS (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible) model including deaths outside hospitals and separate assessments of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases (based on seroprevalence) with different immunological memories. Optimal model parameters are in part identified by Monte Carlo based Least Square Error methods while micro-outbreaks are modeled by noise and explored in Monte Carlo simulations. Estimates for infected population sizes are obtained by using a quasi steady state method. RESULTS: The calculations and simulations made by the model were shown to fit with the observed development of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark. The antibody prevalence in the general population in May 2020 was 1.37%, which yields a relative frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of 1 to 5.2. Due to the large asymptomatic population, the Infection Mortality Rate was only 0.4%. However, with no non-pharmacological restrictions the COVID-19 death toll was calculated to have more than doubled the national average yearly deaths within a year. The transmission rate Re0 was 5.4 in the initial free epidemic period, 0.4 in the lock-down period and 0.8-1.0 in the successive re-opening periods through August 2020. The large asymptomatic population made the termination of the epidemic difficult and micro-outbreaks occurred when the country re-opened. The estimated infected population size July 15 to August 15 was 2,100 and 12,200 for October 1-20, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the model show, that COVID-19 has a low Infection Fatality Rate because the majority of infected persons are either asymptomatic or with few symptoms. A minority of the infected persons, therefore, requires hospitalization. That means that for a given infection pressure of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected there will be a lower pressure on the capacity of the health care system than previously predicted. Further the epidemic will be difficult to terminate since about 84% of the infected individuals are asymptomatic but still contagious. The model may be useful if a major infection wave occurs in the autumn-winter season as it could make robust estimates both for the scale of an ongoing expanding epidemic and for the expected load on the healthcare system. The simulation may also be useful to evaluate different testing strategies based on estimated infected population sizes. The model can be adjusted and scaled to other regions and countries, which is illustrated with Spain and USA.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Traditionally Hawkes processes are a continuous-time process, however we enable these models to be applied to a wider range of problems by considering a discrete-time variant of Hawkes processes. We illustrate this through the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a substantive case study. While alternative models, such as compartmental and growth curve models, have been widely applied to the COVID-19 epidemic, the use of discrete-time Hawkes processes allows us to gain alternative insights. This paper evaluates the capability of discrete-time Hawkes processes by modelling daily mortality counts as distinct phases in the COVID-19 outbreak. We first consider the initial stage of exponential growth and the subsequent decline as preventative measures become effective. We then explore subsequent phases with more recent data. Various countries that have been adversely affected by the epidemic are considered, namely, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. These countries are all unique concerning the spread of the virus and their corresponding response measures. However, we find that this simple model is useful in accurately capturing the dynamics of the process, despite hidden interactions that are not directly modelled due to their complexity, and differences both within and between countries. The utility of this model is not confined to the current COVID-19 epidemic, rather this model could explain many other complex phenomena. It is of interest to have simple models that adequately describe these complex processes with unknown dynamics. As models become more complex, a simpler representation of the process can be desirable for the sake of parsimony.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We also quantified the impact of misclassification error bias on publicly reported case data in Maryland. Using a stratified random sampling approach, 50,000 individuals were selected from a simulated Maryland population to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19. We examined the situation when the true prevalence is low (0.07%-2%), medium (2%-5%), and high (6%-10%). Bayesian models informed by published validity estimates were used to account for misclassification error when estimating COVID-19 prevalence. Adjustment for misclassification error captured the true prevalence 100% of the time, irrespective of the true prevalence level. When adjustment for misclassification error was not done, the results highly varied depending on the population's underlying true prevalence and the type of diagnostic test used. Generally, the prevalence estimates without adjustment for misclassification error worsened as the true prevalence level increased. Adjustment for misclassification error for publicly reported Maryland data led to a minimal but not significant increase in the estimated average daily cases. Random sampling and testing of COVID-19 are needed with adjustment for misclassification error to improve COVID-19 prevalence estimates.",Diagnosis;Epidemic Forecasting

However, most methods for estimating the basic reproductive number (R0) and time-varying effective reproductive number (Rt) assume that the fraction of cases detected and reported is constant through time. We explore the impact of secular changes in diagnostic testing and reporting on estimates of R0 and Rt using simulated data. We then compare these patterns to data on reported cases of coronavirus disease and testing practices from different states in the United States from March 4 to August 30, 2020. We find that changes in testing practices and delays in reporting can result in biased estimates of R0 and Rt. Examination of changes in the daily number of tests conducted and the percent of patients testing positive may be helpful for identifying the potential direction of bias. Changes in diagnostic testing and reporting processes should be monitored and taken into consideration when interpreting estimates of the reproductive number of coronavirus disease.",Epidemic Forecasting;Transmission

As of December 14, 2020, it has caused an epidemic outbreak with more than 73 million confirmed infections and above 1.5 million reported deaths worldwide. During this period of an epidemic when human-to-human transmission is established and reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rising worldwide, investigation of control strategies and forecasting are necessary for health care planning. In this study, we propose and analyze a compartmental epidemic model of COVID-19 to predict and control the outbreak. The basic reproduction number and the control reproduction number are calculated analytically. A detailed stability analysis of the model is performed to observe the dynamics of the system. We calibrated the proposed model to fit daily data from the United Kingdom (UK) where the situation is still alarming. Our findings suggest that independent self-sustaining human-to-human spread ( R 0 > 1 , R c > 1 ) is already present. Short-term predictions show that the decreasing trend of new COVID-19 cases is well captured by the model. Further, we found that effective management of quarantined individuals is more effective than management of isolated individuals to reduce the disease burden. Thus, if limited resources are available, then investing on the quarantined individuals will be more fruitful in terms of reduction of cases.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

33824936,Disease momentum: Estimating the reproduction number in the presence of superspreading.,covid-19;overdispersion;reproduction number;superspreading,"A primary quantity of interest in the study of infectious diseases is the average number of new infections that an infected person produces. This so-called reproduction number has significant implications for the disease progression. There has been increasing literature suggesting that superspreading, the significant variability in number of new infections caused by individuals, plays an important role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, we consider the effect that such superspreading has on the estimation of the reproduction number and subsequent estimates of future cases. Accordingly, we employ a simple extension to models currently used in the literature to estimate the reproduction number and present a case-study of the progression of COVID-19 in Austria. Our models demonstrate that the estimation uncertainty of the reproduction number increases with superspreading and that this improves the performance of prediction intervals. Of independent interest is the derivation of a transparent formula that connects the extent of superspreading to the width of credible intervals for the reproduction number. This serves as a valuable heuristic for understanding the uncertainty surrounding diseases with superspreading.",Epidemic Forecasting

However, the existing studies on COVID-19 prediction are dominated by constant model parameters, unable to reflect the actual situation of COVID-19 spread. This paper presents a new method for dynamic prediction of COVID-19 spread by considering time-dependent model parameters. This method discretises the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-dead (SEIRD) epidemiological model in time domain to construct the nonlinear state-space equation for dynamic estimation of COVID-19 spread. A maximum likelihood estimation theory is established to online estimate time-dependent model parameters. Subsequently, an extended Kalman filter is developed to estimate dynamic COVID-19 spread based on the online estimated model parameters. The proposed method is applied to simulate and analyse the COVID-19 pandemics in China and the United States based on daily reported cases, demonstrating its efficacy in modelling and prediction of COVID-19 spread.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33824378,Global short-term forecasting of COVID-19 cases.,,"The continuously growing number of COVID-19 cases pressures healthcare services worldwide. Accurate short-term forecasting is thus vital to support country-level policy making. The strategies adopted by countries to combat the pandemic vary, generating different uncertainty levels about the actual number of cases. Accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data and accommodating extra-variability is therefore fundamental. We introduce a new modelling framework to describe the pandemic's course with great accuracy and provide short-term daily forecasts for every country in the world. We show that our model generates highly accurate forecasts up to seven days ahead and use estimated model components to cluster countries based on recent events. We introduce statistical novelty in terms of modelling the autoregressive parameter as a function of time, increasing predictive power and flexibility to adapt to each country. Our model can also be used to forecast the number of deaths, study the effects of covariates (such as lockdown policies), and generate forecasts for smaller regions within countries. Consequently, it has substantial implications for global planning and decision making. We present forecasts and make all results freely available to any country in the world through an online Shiny dashboard.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33822785,Assessing required SARS-CoV-2 blanket testing rates for possible control of the outbreak in the epicentre Lusaka province of Zambia with consideration for asymptomatic individuals: A simple mathematical modelling study.,,"INTRODUCTION: The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), in Africa is characterised by a more substantial proportion of asymptomatic (or mildly symptomatic) individuals thought to be playing a role in the spread of the infection. The exact proportion and degree of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals remains unclear. Studies however indicate that their management is crucial for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODOLOGY: We developed a simplified deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical model to assess the effect of active isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected but asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing for control of the outbreak in Lusaka Province of Zambia. Here we modelled two scenarios; (1) assuming asymptomatic individuals comprised 70% of all COVID-19 cases and (2) asymptomatic individuals comprised only 50% of the cases. For contrast, the model was assessed first under the assumption that asymptomatic individuals are equally as infectious as symptomatic individuals and then secondly, and more likely, assuming asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious as symptomatic individuals. RESULTS: For the model assuming 70% asymptomatic cases, a minimum sustained daily blanket testing rate of >/= 7911 tests/100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak if asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious while if equal infectiousness was assumed then a testing rate of >/= 10028 tests/ 100000 population would be required. For 50% asymptomatic, minimum blanket testing rates of >/= 4540 tests/ 100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak at both assumed levels of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our model predicts that active isolation of COVID-19 cases, including asymptomatic individuals, through blanket testing can be used as a possible measure for the control of the SARS-Cov-2 transmission in Lusaka, Zambia, but it would come at a high cost.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33822066,Development of COVIDVax Model to Estimate the Risk of SARS-CoV-2-Related Death Among 7.6 Million US Veterans for Use in Vaccination Prioritization.,,"Importance: A strategy that prioritizes individuals for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination according to their risk of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality would help minimize deaths during vaccine rollout. Objective: To develop a model that estimates the risk of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality among all enrollees of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prognostic study used data from 7635064 individuals enrolled in the VA health care system as of May 21, 2020, to develop and internally validate a logistic regression model (COVIDVax) that predicted SARS-CoV-2-related death (n = 2422) during the observation period (May 21 to November 2, 2020) using baseline characteristics known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, extracted from the VA electronic health records (EHRs). The cohort was split into a training period (May 21 to September 30) and testing period (October 1 to November 2). Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2-related death, defined as death within 30 days of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. VA EHR data streams were imported on a data integration platform to demonstrate that the model could be executed in real-time to produce dashboards with risk scores for all current VA enrollees. Results: Of 7635064 individuals, the mean (SD) age was 66.2 (13.8) years, and most were men (7051912 [92.4%]) and White individuals (4887338 [64.0%]), with 1116435 (14.6%) Black individuals and 399634 (5.2%) Hispanic individuals. From a starting pool of 16 potential predictors, 10 were included in the final COVIDVax model, as follows: sex, age, race, ethnicity, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and Care Assessment Need score. The model exhibited excellent discrimination with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 85.3% (95% CI, 84.6%-86.1%), superior to the AUROC of using age alone to stratify risk (72.6%; 95% CI, 71.6%-73.6%). Assuming vaccination is 90% effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2-related death, using this model to prioritize vaccination was estimated to prevent 63.5% of deaths that would occur by the time 50% of VA enrollees are vaccinated, significantly higher than the estimate for prioritizing vaccination based on age (45.6%) or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention phases of vaccine allocation (41.1%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this prognostic study of all VA enrollees, prioritizing vaccination based on the COVIDVax model was estimated to prevent a large proportion of deaths expected to occur during vaccine rollout before sufficient herd immunity is achieved.",Diagnosis;Epidemic Forecasting;Treatment
33821922,Comparison of Estimated Effectiveness of Case-Based and Population-Based Interventions on COVID-19 Containment in Taiwan.,,"Importance: Taiwan is one of the few countries with initial success in COVID-19 control without strict lockdown or school closure. The reasons remain to be fully elucidated. Objective: To compare and evaluate the effectiveness of case-based (including contact tracing and quarantine) and population-based (including social distancing and facial masking) interventions for COVID-19 in Taiwan. Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness study used a stochastic branching process model using COVID-19 epidemic data from Taiwan, an island nation of 23.6 million people, with no locally acquired cases of COVID-19 reported for 253 days between April and December 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Effective reproduction number of COVID-19 cases (the number of secondary cases generated by 1 primary case) and the probability of outbreak extinction (0 new cases within 20 generations). For model development and calibration, an estimation of the incubation period (interval from exposure to symptom onset), serial interval (time between symptom onset in an infector-infectee pair), and the statistical distribution of the number of any subsequent infections generated by 1 primary case was calculated. Results: This study analyzed data from 158 confirmed COVID-19 cases (median age, 45 years; interquartile range, 25-55 years; 84 men [53%]). An estimated 55% (95% credible interval [CrI], 41%-68%) of transmission events occurred during the presymptomatic stage. In our estimated analysis, case detection, contact tracing, and 14-day quarantine of close contacts (regardless of symptoms) was estimated to decrease the reproduction number from the counterfactual value of 2.50 to 1.53 (95% CrI, 1.50-1.57), which would not be sufficient for epidemic control, which requires a value of less than 1. In our estimated analysis, voluntary population-based interventions, if used alone, were estimated to have reduced the reproduction number to 1.30 (95% CrI, 1.03-1.58). Combined case-based and population-based interventions were estimated to reduce the reproduction number to below unity (0.85; 95% CrI, 0.78-0.89). Results were similar for additional analyses with influenza data and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: In this comparative effectiveness research study, the combination of case-based and population-based interventions (with wide adherence) may explain the success of COVID-19 control in Taiwan in 2020. Either category of interventions alone would have been insufficient, even in a country with an effective public health system and comprehensive contact tracing program.

As we known, the epidemic was caused by imported cases in other provinces of China except for Hubei in 2020. In this paper, we developed a differential equation model with tracing isolation strategy with close contacts of newly confirmed cases and discrete time imported cases, to perform assessment and risk analysis for COVID-19 outbreaks in Tianjin and Chongqing city. Firstly, the model behavior without imported cases was given. Then, the real-time regeneration number in Tianjin and Chongqing city revealed a trend of rapidly rising, and then falling fast. Finally, sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the earlier with Wuhan lock-down, the fewer cases in these two cities. One can obtain that the tracing isolation of close contacts of newly confirmed cases could effectively control the spread of the disease. But it is not sensitive for the more contact tracing isolation days on confirmed cases, the fewer cases. Our investigation model could be potentially helpful to provide model building technology for the transmission of COVID-19.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

We model the direct and indirect transmission pathways with a S A D O I R ode model. Our proposal explicitly includes compartments for the contaminated objects, susceptible individuals, asymptomatic infectious, detected infectious, and recovered individuals.

By December 24, there are over 77M cumulative confirmed cases with more than 1.72M deaths worldwide. To mathematically describe the dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose a time-dependent SEIR model considering the incubation period. Furthermore, we take immunity, reinfection, and vaccination into account and propose the SEVIS model. Unlike the classic SIR based models with constant parameters, our dynamic models not only predicts the number of cases, but also monitors the trajectories of changing parameters, such as transmission rate, recovery rate, and the basic reproduction number. Tracking these parameters, we observe the significant decrease in the transmission rate in the U.S. after the authority announced a series of orders aiming to prevent the spread of the virus, such as closing non-essential businesses and lockdown restrictions. Months later, as restrictions being gradually lifted, we notice a new surge of infection emerges as the transmission rates show increasing trends in some states. Using our epidemiology models, people can track, timely monitor, and predict the COVID-19 pandemic with precision. To illustrate and validate our model, we use the national level data (the U.S.) and the state level data (New York and North Dakota), and the resulting relative prediction errors for the infected group and recovered group are mostly lower than 0.5%.

The rigorous analysis of the mathematical model is provided. We provide also a rigorous derivation of the basic reproduction number R 0 . For R 0 < 1 , we prove that the Disease Free Equilibium (DFE) is Globally Asymptotically Stable (GAS), thus COVID-19 extincts; whereas for R 0 > 1 , we found the co-existing phenomena under some assumptions and parametric values. Elasticity indices for R 0 with respect to different parameters are calculated with baseline parameter values estimated. We also prove that a transcritical bifurcation occurs at R 0 = 1 . Taking into account the control strategies like screening, treatment and isolation (social distancing measures), we present the optimal control problem of minimizing the cost due to the application of these measures. By reducing the values of some parameters, such as death rates (representing a management effort for all categories of people) and recovered rates (representing the action of reduction in transmission, improved screening, treatment for individuals diagnosed positive to COVID-19 and the implementation of barrier measures limiting contamination for undiagnosed individuals), it appears that after 140 - 170 days, the peak of the pandemic is reached and shows that by continuing with this strategy, COVID-19 could be eliminated in the population.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The results show that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R cvd19 < 1. On the other hand, the global asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium occurs if R cvd19 > 1. The mathematical analysis of the model is supported using numerical simulations. Moreover, the model's analysis and numerical results prove that the consistent use of face masks would go on a long way in reducing the COVID-19 pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33814968,Computational simulation of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SEIR stochastic model.,covid-19;numerical simulations;parallel computing;seir stochastic model,"A small number of individuals infected within a community can lead to the rapid spread of the disease throughout that community, leading to an epidemic outbreak. This is even more true for highly contagious diseases such as COVID-19, known to be caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Mathematical models of epidemics allow estimating several impacts on the population and, therefore, are of great use for the definition of public health policies. Some of these measures include the isolation of the infected (also known as quarantine), and the vaccination of the susceptible. In a possible scenario in which a vaccine is available, but with limited access, it is necessary to quantify the levels of vaccination to be applied, taking into account the continued application of preventive measures. This work concerns the simulation of the spread of the COVID-19 disease in a community by applying the Monte Carlo method to a Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered (SEIR) stochastic epidemic model. To handle the computational effort involved, a simple parallelization approach was adopted and deployed in a small HPC cluster. The developed computational method allows to realistically simulate the spread of COVID-19 in a medium-sized community and to study the effect of preventive measures such as quarantine and vaccination. The results show that an effective combination of vaccination with quarantine can prevent the appearance of major epidemic outbreaks, even if the critical vaccination coverage is not reached.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Treatment

More specifically, a compartmental epidemic model has been considered, in which vaccination, social distance measures, and testing of susceptible individuals have been included. Since the application of these mitigation measures entails a degree of uncertainty, the effects of the uncertainty about the application of social distance actions and testing of susceptible individuals on the disease transmission have been quantified, under the assumption of a mass vaccination program deployment. A spectral approach has been employed, which allows the uncertainty propagation through the epidemic model to be represented by means of the polynomial chaos expansion of the output random variables. In particular, a statistical moment-based polynomial chaos expansion has been implemented, which provides a surrogate model for the compartments of the epidemic model, and allows the statistics, the probability distributions of the interesting output variables of the model at a given time instant to be estimated and the sensitivity analysis to be conducted. The purpose of the sensitivity analysis is to understand which uncertain parameters have most influence on a given output random variable of the model at a given time instant. Several numerical experiments have been conducted whose results show that the proposed spectral approach to uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of epidemic models provides a useful tool to control and mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, when it comes to healthcare resource planning.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Using gradient information, we accelerated the convergence of the algorithm that enables us to solve well-known complex benchmark functions optimally for the first time in this field. We also used the Gaussian walk and Levy flight to improve the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the GGWO to avoid trapping in local optima. We apply the suggested method to several benchmark functions to show its efficiency. The outcomes reveal that our algorithm performs superior to most existing algorithms in the literature in most benchmarks. Moreover, we apply our algorithm for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Since the prediction of the epidemic is a complicated task due to its stochastic nature, presenting efficient methods to solve the problem is vital. Since the healthcare system has a limited capacity, it is essential to predict the pandemic's future trend to avoid overload. Our results predict that the US will have almost 16 million cases by the end of November. The upcoming peak in the number of infected, ICU admitted cases would be mid-to-end November. In the end, we proposed several managerial insights that will help the policymakers have a clearer vision about the growth of COVID-19 and avoid equipment shortages in healthcare systems.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

To serve to this purpose, the well-documented infection model of SIR is examined in the current research to propose an analytical approach for providing an explicit formula associated with a straightforward computation of peak time of outbreak. Initially, the time scale from the relevant autonomous SIR epidemic model is formulated analytically via an integral based on the fractions of susceptible and infected compartments. Afterwards, through a series expansion of the logarithmic term of the resultant integrand, the peak time is shown to rely upon the fraction of susceptible, the infectious ratio as well as the initial fractions of ill and susceptible individuals. The approximate expression is shown to rigorously capable of capturing the time threshold of illness for an epidemic from the semi-time SIR epidemiology. Otherwise, it is also successful to predict the peak time from a past history of a disease when all-time epidemic model is adopted. Accuracy of the derived expressions are initially confirmed by direct comparisons with recently reported approximate formulas in the literature. Several other epidemic disease samples including the COVID-19 often studied in the recent literature are eventually attacked with favourable performance of the presented formulae for assessing the peak time occurrence of an epidemic. A quick evaluation of the peak time of a disease certainly enables the governments to take early effective epidemic precautions.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33814611,Correcting notification delay and forecasting of COVID-19 data.,covid-19;notification delay;overdispersion;prediction,"Since the first official case of COVID-19 was reported, many researchers around the world have spent their time trying to understand the dynamics of the virus by modeling and predicting the number of infected and deaths. The rapid spread and highly contagiousness motivate the necessity of monitoring cases in real-time, aiming to keep control of the epidemic. As pointed out by [3], some pitfalls like limited infrastructure, laboratory confirmation and logistical problems may cause reporting delay, leading to distortions of the real dynamics of the confirmed cases and deaths. The aim of this study is to propose a suitable statistical methodology for modeling and forecasting daily deaths and reported cases of COVID-19, considering key features as overdispersion of data and correction of notification delay. Both, reporting delays and forecasting consider a Bayesian approach in which the daily deaths and the confirmed cases are modelled using the negative binomial (NB) distribution in order to accommodate the population heterogeneity. For the correction of notification delay, the mean number of occurrences regarding time t notified at time t + j (mean delayed notifications) is associated to the temporal and the delay lag evolution of the notification process through a log link. With regard to daily forecasting, the functional form adopted for the number of deaths and reported cases of COVID-19 is related to the sigmoid growth equation. A variable regarding week days or days off was considered in order to account for possible reduction of the records due to the lower offer of tests on days off. To illustrate the methodology, we analyze data of deaths and infected cases of COVID-19 in Espirito Santo, Brazil. We also obtain long-term predictions.",Epidemic Forecasting

The mathematical model considers the existence of various sub-populations, including humans who are susceptible to the disease, asymptomatic humans, infected humans and recovered or quarantined individuals. Various mechanisms of propagation are considered in order to describe the propagation phenomenon accurately. METHODS: We propose a stochastic extension of the deterministic model, considering a random component which follows a Brownian motion. In view of the difficulties to solve the system exactly, we propose a computational model to approximate its solutions following a nonstandard approach. RESULTS: The nonstandard discretization is fully analyzed for positivity, boundedness and stability. It is worth pointing out that these properties are realized in the discrete scenario and that they are thoroughly established herein using rigorous mathematical arguments. We provide some illustrative computational simulations to exhibit the main computational features of this approach. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the nonstandard technique is capable of preserving the distinctive characteristics of the epidemiologically relevant solutions of the model, while other (classical) approaches are not able to do it. For the sake of convenience, a computational code of the nonstandard discrete model may be provided to the readers at their requests.",Epidemic Forecasting
33811817,Prioritising COVID-19 vaccination in changing social and epidemiological landscapes: a mathematical modelling study.,,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities must decide which groups to prioritise for vaccination in a shifting social-epidemiological landscape in which the success of large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions requires broad social acceptance. We aimed to compare projected COVID-19 mortality under four different strategies for the prioritisation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. METHODS: We developed a coupled social-epidemiological model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in which social and epidemiological dynamics interact with one another. We modelled how population adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions responds to case incidence. In the model, schools and workplaces are also closed and reopened on the basis of reported cases. The model was parameterised with data on COVID-19 cases and mortality, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, population mobility, and demography from Ontario, Canada (population 14.5 million). Disease progression parameters came from the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological literature. We assumed a vaccine with 75% efficacy against disease and transmissibility. We compared vaccinating those aged 60 years and older first (oldest-first strategy), vaccinating those younger than 20 years first (youngest-first strategy), vaccinating uniformly by age (uniform strategy), and a novel contact-based strategy. The latter three strategies interrupt transmission, whereas the first targets a vulnerable group to reduce disease. Vaccination rates ranged from 0.5% to 5% of the population per week, beginning on either Jan 1 or Sept 1, 2021. FINDINGS: Case notifications, non-pharmaceutical intervention adherence, and lockdown undergo successive waves that interact with the timing of the vaccine programme to determine the relative effectiveness of the four strategies. Transmission-interrupting strategies become relatively more effective with time as herd immunity builds. The model predicts that, in the absence of vaccination, 72 000 deaths (95% credible interval 40 000-122 000) would occur in Ontario from Jan 1, 2021, to March 14, 2025, and at a vaccination rate of 1.5% of the population per week, the oldest-first strategy would reduce COVID-19 mortality by 90.8% on average (followed by 89.5% in the uniform, 88.9% in the contact-based, and 88.2% in the youngest-first strategies). 60 000 deaths (31 000-108 000) would occur from Sept 1, 2021, to March 14, 2025, in the absence of vaccination, and the contact-based strategy would reduce COVID-19 mortality by 92.6% on average (followed by 92.1% in the uniform, 91.0% in the oldest-first, and 88.3% in the youngest-first strategies) at a vaccination rate of 1.5% of the population per week. INTERPRETATION: The most effective vaccination strategy for reducing mortality due to COVID-19 depends on the time course of the pandemic in the population. For later vaccination start dates, use of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to interrupt transmission might prevent more deaths than prioritising vulnerable age groups.

The government increased Seoul's social distancing to the 2.5 level, and the number of confirmed cases is increasing daily. Due to a shortage of hospital beds, treatment is difficult. Furthermore, gatherings at the end of the year and the beginning of next year are expected to worsen the effects. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the importance of prediction timing rather than prediction of the number of confirmed cases. Thus, in this study, five groups were set according to minimum, maximum, and high variability. Through empirical data analysis, the groups were subdivided into a total of 19 cases. The cumulative number of COVID-19 confirmed cases is predicted using the auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and compared with the actual number of confirmed cases. Through group and case-by-case prediction, forecasts can accurately determine decreasing and increasing trends. To prevent further spread of COVID-19, urgent and strong government restrictions are needed. This study will help the government and the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) to respond systematically to a future surge in confirmed cases.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

R(t) reflects the epidemic dynamics based on readily available illness onset data, and is useful for the planning and implementation of public health and social measures. In the present study, we proposed a method for computing the R(t) of COVID-19, and applied this method to the epidemic in Osaka prefecture from February to September 2020. We estimated R(t) as a function of the time of infection using the date of illness onset. The epidemic in Osaka came under control around 2 April during the first wave, and 26 July during the second wave. R(t) did not decline drastically following any single intervention. However, when multiple interventions were combined, the relative reductions in R(t) during the first and second waves were 70% and 51%, respectively. Although the second wave was brought under control without declaring a state of emergency, our model comparison indicated that relying on a single intervention would not be sufficient to reduce R(t) < 1.

However, the SEIR model prototype is generic and not able to capture the unique nature of a novel viral pandemic such as SARS-CoV-2. We have developed and tested a specialized version of the SEIR model, called SEAHIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Hospitalized-Isolated-Removed) model. This proposed model is able to capture the unique dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak including further dividing the Infected compartment into: (1) ""Asymptomatic"", (2) ""Isolated"" and (3) ""Hospitalized"" to delineate the transmission specifics of each compartment and forecast healthcare requirements. The model also takes into consideration the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical distancing and different testing strategies on the number of confirmed cases. We used a publicly available dataset from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a case study to optimize the main parameters of the model and benchmarked it against the historical number of cases. The SEAHIR model was used by decision-makers in Dubai's COVID-19 Command and Control Center to make timely decisions on developing testing strategies, increasing healthcare capacity, and implementing interventions to contain the spread of the virus.

To this end we developed a deterministic transmission model based on the renewal equation and fitted the model to daily case and death data in the first few months of 2020 in 79 countries and states, representing 4.2 billions individuals. Based on a region-specific infection fatality ratio, we inferred the time-varying probability of case detection and the time-varying decline in transmissiblity. As a validation, the predicted total number of infected was close to that found in serosurveys; more importantly, the inferred probability of detection strongly correlated with the number of daily tests per inhabitant, with 50 % detection achieved with 0.003 daily tests per inhabitants. Most of the decline in transmission was explained by the reductions in transmissibility (social distancing), which avoided 10 millions deaths in the regions studied over the first four months of 2020. In contrast, symptom-based testing and isolation of positive cases was not an efficient way to control the spread of the disease, as a large part of transmission happens before symptoms and only a small fraction of infected individuals was typically detected. The latter is explained by the limited number of tests available, and the fact that increasing test capacity often increases the probability of detection less than proportionally. Together these results suggest that little control can be achieved by symptom-based testing and isolation alone.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

These measures are imposed in order to reduce the spread of the disease and to lift the pressure on healthcare systems. Estimating the impact of such interventions as well as monitoring the gradual relaxing of these stringent measures is quintessential to understand how resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic can be controlled for in the future. In this paper we use a stochastic age-structured discrete time compartmental model to describe the transmission of COVID-19 in Belgium. Our model explicitly accounts for age-structure by integrating data on social contacts to (i) assess the impact of the lockdown as implemented on March 13, 2020 on the number of new hospitalizations in Belgium; (ii) conduct a scenario analysis estimating the impact of possible exit strategies on potential future COVID-19 waves. More specifically, the aforementioned model is fitted to hospital admission data, data on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths and serial serological survey data informing the (sero)prevalence of the disease in the population while relying on a Bayesian MCMC approach. Our age-structured stochastic model describes the observed outbreak data well, both in terms of hospitalizations as well as COVID-19 related deaths in the Belgian population. Despite an extensive exploration of various projections for the future course of the epidemic, based on the impact of adherence to measures of physical distancing and a potential increase in contacts as a result of the relaxation of the stringent lockdown measures, a lot of uncertainty remains about the evolution of the epidemic in the next months.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In particular we discuss the worst affected large countries like India, Brazil and USA for estimating effect of vaccination rate in expediting the end of the COVID-19 epidemic. We analytically simulated the dynamic evolution of active cases of these countries in the last nine months using the modified SIR model and then included the effect of vaccination to forecast the proliferation dynamics.

Although extremely useful in many tasks, most models have performed poorly in forecasting the pandemic peaks. We investigate this common pitfall by forecasting four countries' pandemic peak: Austria, Germany, Italy, and South Korea. Far from the peaks, our models can forecast the pandemic dynamics 20 days ahead. Nevertheless, when calibrating our models close to the day of the pandemic peak, all forecasts fail. Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis revealed the main obstacle: the misestimation of the transmission rate. Inverse uncertainty quantification has shown that significant changes in transmission rate commonly precede a peak. These changes are a key factor in forecasting the pandemic peak. Long forecasts of the pandemic peak are therefore undermined by the lack of models that can forecast changes in the transmission rate, i.e., how a particular society behaves, changes of mitigation policies, or how society chooses to respond to them. In addition, our studies revealed that even short forecasts of the pandemic peak are challenging. Backward projections have shown us that the correct estimation of any temporal change in the transmission rate is only possible many days ahead. Our results suggest that the distance between a change in the transmission rate and its correct identification in the curve of active infected cases can be as long as 15 days. This is intrinsic to the phenomenon and how it affects epidemic data: a new case is usually only reported after an incubation period followed by a delay associated with the test. In summary, our results suggest the phenomenon itself challenges the task of forecasting the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic when only epidemic data is available. Nevertheless, we show that exciting results can be obtained when using the same models to project different scenarios of reduced transmission rates. Therefore, our results highlight that mathematical modeling can help control COVID-19 pandemic by backward projections that characterize the phenomena' essential features and forward projections when different scenarios and strategies can be tested and used for decision-making.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The reproductive number (R) is a metric to estimate the transmission of a pathogen during an outbreak. Preliminary published estimates were based on the initial outbreak in China. Whole genome sequences (WGS) analysis found mutational variations in the viral genome; however, previous comparisons failed to show a direct relationship between viral genome diversity, transmission, and the epidemic severity. COVID-19 incidences from different countries were modeled over the epidemic curve. Estimates of the instantaneous R (Wallinga and Teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval were done. WGS were used to determine the populations genomic variation and that underpinned creation of the pathogen genome identity (GENI) score, which was merged with the outbreak curve in four distinct phases. Inference of transmission time was based on a mutation rate of 2 mutations/month. R estimates revealed differences in the transmission and variable infection dynamics between and within outbreak progression for each country examined. Outside China, our R estimates observed propagating dynamics indicating that other countries were poised to move to the takeoff and exponential stages. Population density and local temperatures had no clear relationship to the outbreak progression. Integration of incidence data with the GENI score directly predicted increases in cases as the genome variation increased that led to new variants. Integrating the outbreak curve, dynamic R, and SNP variation found a direct association between increasing cases and transmission genome evolution. By defining the epidemic curve into four stages and integrating the instantaneous country-specific R with the GENI score, we directly connected changes in individual outbreaks based on changes in the virus genome via SNPs. This resulted in the ability to forecast potential increases in cases as well as mutations that may defeat PCR screening and the infection process. By using instantaneous R estimations and WGS, outbreak dynamics were defined to be linked to viral mutations, indicating that WGS, as a surveillance tool, is required to predict shifts in each outbreak that will provide actionable decision making information. Integrating epidemiology with genome sequencing and modeling allows for evidence-based disease outbreak tracking with predictive therapeutically valuable insights in near real time.",Epidemic Forecasting;Mechanism;Transmission
33793551,Predicting the cumulative medical load of COVID-19 outbreaks after the peak in daily fatalities.,,"The distinct ways the COVID-19 pandemic has been unfolding in different countries and regions suggest that local societal and governmental structures play an important role not only for the baseline infection rate, but also for short and long-term reactions to the outbreak. We propose to investigate the question of how societies as a whole, and governments in particular, modulate the dynamics of a novel epidemic using a generalization of the SIR model, the reactive SIR (short-term and long-term reaction) model. We posit that containment measures are equivalent to a feedback between the status of the outbreak and the reproduction factor. Short-term reaction to an outbreak corresponds in this framework to the reaction of governments and individuals to daily cases and fatalities. The reaction to the cumulative number of cases or deaths, and not to daily numbers, is captured in contrast by long-term reaction. We present the exact phase space solution of the controlled SIR model and use it to quantify containment policies for a large number of countries in terms of short and long-term control parameters. We find increased contributions of long-term control for countries and regions in which the outbreak was suppressed substantially together with a strong correlation between the strength of societal and governmental policies and the time needed to contain COVID-19 outbreaks. Furthermore, for numerous countries and regions we identified a predictive relation between the number of fatalities within a fixed period before and after the peak of daily fatality counts, which allows to gauge the cumulative medical load of COVID-19 outbreaks that should be expected after the peak. These results suggest that the proposed model is applicable not only for understanding the outbreak dynamics, but also for predicting future cases and fatalities once the effectiveness of outbreak suppression policies is established with sufficient certainty. Finally, we provide a web app (https://itp.uni-frankfurt.de/covid-19/) with tools for visualising the phase space representation of real-world COVID-19 data and for exporting the preprocessed data for further analysis.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Despite the pandemic is raging in most parts of the world, in a few countries COVID-19 epidemics subsided due to successful implementations of intervention measures. A unifying perspective of the beginnings, middle stages, and endings of such completed COVID-19 epidemics is developed based on the order parameter and eigenvalue concepts of nonlinear physics, in general, and synergetics, in particular. To this end, a standard susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model is used. It is shown that COVID-19 epidemic outbreaks follow a suitably defined SEIR order parameter. Intervention measures switch the eigenvalue of the order parameter from a positive to a negative value, and in doing so, stabilize the COVID-19 disease-free state. The subsiding of COVID-19 epidemics eventually follows the remnant of the order parameter of the infection dynamical system. These considerations are illustrated for the COVID-19 epidemic in Thailand from January to May 2020. The decay of effective contact rates throughout the three epidemic stages is demonstrated. Evidence for the sign-switching of the dominant eigenvalue is given and the order parameter and its stage-3 remnant are identified.

33784239,Spatial-Temporal Relationship Between Population Mobility and COVID-19 Outbreaks in South Carolina: Time Series Forecasting Analysis.,covid-19;south carolina;incidence;mobility,"BACKGROUND: Population mobility is closely associated with COVID-19 transmission, and it could be used as a proximal indicator to predict future outbreaks, which could inform proactive nonpharmaceutical interventions for disease control. South Carolina is one of the US states that reopened early, following which it experienced a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to examine the spatial-temporal relationship between population mobility and COVID-19 outbreaks and use population mobility data to predict daily new cases at both the state and county level in South Carolina. METHODS: This longitudinal study used disease surveillance data and Twitter-based population mobility data from March 6 to November 11, 2020, in South Carolina and its five counties with the largest number of cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases. Population mobility was assessed based on the number of Twitter users with a travel distance greater than 0.5 miles. A Poisson count time series model was employed for COVID-19 forecasting. RESULTS: Population mobility was positively associated with state-level daily COVID-19 incidence as well as incidence in the top five counties (ie, Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland). At the state level, the final model with a time window within the last 7 days had the smallest prediction error, and the prediction accuracy was as high as 98.7%, 90.9%, and 81.6% for the next 3, 7, and 14 days, respectively. Among Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland counties, the best predictive models were established based on their observations in the last 9, 14, 28, 20, and 9 days, respectively. The 14-day prediction accuracy ranged from 60.3%-74.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Using Twitter-based population mobility data could provide acceptable predictions of COVID-19 daily new cases at both the state and county level in South Carolina. Population mobility measured via social media data could inform proactive measures and resource relocations to curb disease outbreaks and their negative influences.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33783826,Inferring UK COVID-19 fatal infection trajectories from daily mortality data: Were infections already in decline before the UK lockdowns?,npi;sars-cov-2;lockdown efficacy;lockdown impact;semiparametric,"The number of new infections per day is a key quantity for effective epidemic management. It can be estimated relatively directly by testing of random population samples. Without such direct epidemiological measurement, other approaches are required to infer whether the number of new cases is likely to be increasing or decreasing: for example, estimating the pathogen-effective reproduction number, R, using data gathered from the clinical response to the disease. For coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19/SARS-Cov-2), such R estimation is heavily dependent on modelling assumptions, because the available clinical case data are opportunistic observational data subject to severe temporal confounding. Given this difficulty, it is useful to retrospectively reconstruct the time course of infections from the least compromised available data, using minimal prior assumptions. A Bayesian inverse problem approach applied to UK data on first-wave Covid-19 deaths and the disease duration distribution suggests that fatal infections were in decline before full UK lockdown (24 March 2020), and that fatal infections in Sweden started to decline only a day or two later. An analysis of UK data using the model of Flaxman et al. gives the same result under relaxation of its prior assumptions on R, suggesting an enhanced role for non-pharmaceutical interventions short of full lockdown in the UK context. Similar patterns appear to have occurred in the subsequent two lockdowns.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

When the disease progression is long such as for HIV, individuals often experience switches among different states. We derive an epidemic model in which infected individuals have a discrete set of states of infectivity and can switch among different states. The model also incorporates a general incidence form in which new infections are distributed among different disease states. We discuss the importance of the transmission-transfer network for infectious diseases. Under the assumption that the transmission-transfer network is strongly connected, we establish that the basic reproduction number R 0 is a sharp threshold parameter: if R 0 </= 1 , the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and the disease always dies out; if R 0 > 1 , the disease-free equilibrium is unstable, the system is uniformly persistent and initial outbreaks lead to persistent disease infection. For a restricted class of incidence functions, we prove that there is a unique endemic equilibrium and it is globally asymptotically stable when R 0 > 1 . Furthermore, we discuss the impact of different state structures on R 0 , on the distribution of the disease states at the unique endemic equilibrium, and on disease control and preventions. Implications to the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We explored two models developed by Imperial College that considered only NPIs without accounting for mobility (model 1) or only mobility (model 2), and a model accounting for the combination of mobility and NPIs (model 3). Imperial College applied models 1 and 2 to 11 European countries and to the USA, respectively. We applied these models to 14 European countries (original 11 plus another 3), over two different time horizons. RESULTS: While model 1 found that lockdown was the most effective measure in the original 11 countries, model 2 showed that lockdown had little or no benefit as it was typically introduced at a point when the time-varying reproduction number was already very low. Model 3 found that the simple banning of public events was beneficial, while lockdown had no consistent impact. Based on Bayesian metrics, model 2 was better supported by the data than either model 1 or model 3 for both time horizons. CONCLUSION: Inferences on effects of NPIs are non-robust and highly sensitive to model specification. In the SIR modeling framework, the impacts of lockdown are uncertain and highly model-dependent.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In this context, how to accurately predict the turning point, duration and final scale of the epidemic in different countries, regions or cities is key to enabling decision makers and public health departments to formulate intervention measures and deploy resources. METHODS: Based on COVID-19 surveillance data and human mobility data, this study predicts the epidemic trends of national and state regional administrative units in the United States from July 27, 2020, to January 22, 2021, by constructing a SIRD model considering the factors of ""lockdown"" and ""riot"". RESULTS: (1) The spread of the epidemic in the USA has the characteristics of geographical proximity. (2) During the lockdown period, there was a strong correlation between the number of COVID-19 infected cases and residents' activities in recreational areas such as parks. (3) The turning point (the point of time in which active infected cases peak) of the early epidemic in the USA was predicted to occur in September. (4) Among the 10 states experiencing the most severe epidemic, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Texas, Illinois, Pennsylvania and California are all predicted to meet the turning point in a concentrated period from July to September, while the turning point in Georgia is forecast to occur in December. No turning points in Florida and Arizona were foreseen for the forecast period, with the number of infected cases still set to be growing rapidly. CONCLUSIONS: The model was found accurately to predict the future trend of the epidemic and can be applied to other countries. It is worth noting that in the early stage there is no vaccine or approved pharmaceutical intervention for this disease, making the fight against the pandemic reliant on non-pharmaceutical interventions. Therefore, reducing mobility, focusing on personal protection and increasing social distance remain still the most effective measures to date.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33780443,Pandemic velocity: Forecasting COVID-19 in the US with a machine learning & Bayesian time series compartmental model.,,"Predictions of COVID-19 case growth and mortality are critical to the decisions of political leaders, businesses, and individuals grappling with the pandemic. This predictive task is challenging due to the novelty of the virus, limited data, and dynamic political and societal responses. We embed a Bayesian time series model and a random forest algorithm within an epidemiological compartmental model for empirically grounded COVID-19 predictions. The Bayesian case model fits a location-specific curve to the velocity (first derivative) of the log transformed cumulative case count, borrowing strength across geographic locations and incorporating prior information to obtain a posterior distribution for case trajectories. The compartmental model uses this distribution and predicts deaths using a random forest algorithm trained on COVID-19 data and population-level characteristics, yielding daily projections and interval estimates for cases and deaths in U.S. states. We evaluated the model by training it on progressively longer periods of the pandemic and computing its predictive accuracy over 21-day forecasts. The substantial variation in predicted trajectories and associated uncertainty between states is illustrated by comparing three unique locations: New York, Colorado, and West Virginia. The sophistication and accuracy of this COVID-19 model offer reliable predictions and uncertainty estimates for the current trajectory of the pandemic in the U.S. and provide a platform for future predictions as shifting political and societal responses alter its course.",Epidemic Forecasting

The model has four components leading to a system of fractional order differential equations incorporating the refuge concept to study the lockdown effect in controlling COVID-19 spread in India.

The goal of this model is to estimate the number of total infected, active cases, deaths, as well as recoveries from COVID-19 to control or minimize the above issues in India. The existence, uniqueness, non-negativity, and boundedness of the solutions are established. In addition, the local and global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium points of the fractional-order system and the basic reproduction number are studied for understanding and prediction of the transmission of COVID-19 in India. The next step is to carry out sensitivity analysis to find out which parameter is the most dominant to affect the disease's endemicity.

The pandemic dynamics of COVID-19 needs to be studied in detail. A pandemic model with hierarchical quarantine and time delay is proposed in this paper. In the COVID-19 case, the virus incubation period and the antibody failure will cause the time delay and reinfection, respectively, and the hierarchical quarantine strategy includes home isolation and quarantine in hospital. These factors that affect the spread of COVID-19 are well considered and analyzed in the model. The stability of the equilibrium and the nonlinear dynamics is studied as well. The threshold value tau k of the bifurcation is deduced and quantitatively analyzed. Numerical simulations are performed to establish the analytical results with suitable examples. The research reveals that the COVID-19 outbreak may recur over a period of time, which can be helpful to increase the number of tested people with or without symptoms in order to be able to early identify the clusters of infection.

Having seen such a drastic situation, a relatively simple epidemiological SIR model with Caputo derivative is suggested unlike more sophisticated models being proposed nowadays in the current literature.

To further analyze qualitative behavior of the Caputo SIR model, uniqueness conditions under the Banach contraction principle are discussed and stability analysis with basic reproduction number is investigated using Ulam-Hyers and its generalized version. The best parameters have been obtained via the nonlinear least-squares curve fitting technique. The infectious compartment of the Caputo SIR model fits the real data better than the classical version of the SIR model (Brauer et al. in Mathematical Models in Epidemiology 2019).

Because the epidemic started later in Turkey than other European countries, it has the least number of deaths according to the current data. Outbreak management in COVID-19 is of great importance for public safety and public health. For this reason, prediction models can decide the precautionary warning to control the spread of the disease. Therefore, this study aims to develop a forecasting model, considering statistical data for Turkey. Box-Jenkins Methods (ARIMA), Brown's Exponential Smoothing model and RNN-LSTM are employed. ARIMA was selected with the lowest AIC values (12.0342, -2.51411, 12.0253, 3.67729, -4.24405, and 3.66077) as the best fit for the number of total case, the growth rate of total cases, the number of new cases, the number of total death, the growth rate of total deaths and the number of new deaths, respectively. The forecast values of the number of each indicator are stable over time. In the near future, it will not show an increasing trend in the number of cases for Turkey. In addition, the pandemic will become a steady state and an increase in mortality rates will not be expected between 17-31 May.

After proving the existence and global asymptotic stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points of the model with constant parameters, we consider a family of Cauchy problems, with piecewise constant parameters, and prove the existence of pseudo-oscillations between a neighborhood of the disease-free equilibrium and a neighborhood of the endemic equilibrium, in a biologically feasible region. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this pseudo-periodic solutions are related to the emergence of epidemic waves. Then, to capture the impact of mobility in the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemics, we propose a complex network with six distinct regions based on COVID-19 real data from Portugal.

We apply the method to assess excess mortality from March to June 2020 in Denmark and Sweden as a result of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic; associated policy interventions; and behavioral, healthcare, social, and economic changes. We chose to compare Denmark and Sweden because reliable data were available and because the two countries are similar but chose different responses to COVID-19: Denmark imposed a rather severe lockdown; Sweden did not. We make forecasts by age and sex to predict expected deaths if COVID-19 had not struck. Subtracting these forecasts from observed deaths gives the excess death count. Excess deaths were lower in Denmark than Sweden during the first wave of the pandemic. The later/earlier ratio we propose for shortcasting is easy to understand, requires less data than more elaborate approaches, and may be useful in many countries in making both predictions about the future and the past to study the impact on mortality of coronavirus and other epidemics. In the application to Denmark and Sweden, prediction intervals are narrower and bias is less than when forecasts are based on averages of the last 5 y, as is often done.

In particular, the data from Nepal, a developing country having an open border provision with highly COVID-19 affected country India, has shown a biphasic pattern of epidemic, a controlled phase (until July 21, 2020) followed by an outgrown phase (after July 21, 2020). To uncover the effective strategies implemented during the controlled phase, we develop a mathematical model that is able to describe the data from both phases of COVID-19 dynamics in Nepal. Using our best parameter estimates with 95% confidence interval, we found that during the controlled phase most of the recorded cases were imported from outside the country with a small number generated from the local transmission, consistent with the data. Our model predicts that these successful strategies were able to maintain the reproduction number at around 0.21 during the controlled phase, preventing 442,640 cases of COVID-19 and saving more than 1,200 lives in Nepal. However, during the outgrown phase, when the strategies such as border screening and quarantine, lockdown, and detection and isolation, were altered, the reproduction number raised to 1.8, resulting in exponentially growing cases of COVID-19. We further used our model to predict the long-term dynamics of COVID-19 in Nepal and found that without any interventions the current trend may result in about 18.76 million cases (10.70 million detected and 8.06 million undetected) and 89 thousand deaths in Nepal by the end of 2021.

We established a modelling support team to facilitate the application of epidemiological modelling analyses in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) countries. Here, we present an innovative, stepwise approach to participatory modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic that engaged decision-makers and public health professionals from countries throughout all stages of the modelling process. Our approach consisted of first identifying the relevant policy questions, collecting country-specific data and interpreting model findings from a decision-maker's perspective, as well as communicating model uncertainty. We used a simple modelling methodology that was adaptable to the shortage of epidemiological data, and the limited modelling capacity, in our region. We discuss the benefits of using models to produce rapid decision-making guidance for COVID-19 control in the WHO EMR, as well as challenges that we have experienced regarding conveying uncertainty associated with model results, synthesising and comparing results across multiple modelling approaches, and modelling fragile and conflict-affected states.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33758734,"Recurrent neural network ensemble, a new instrument for the prediction of infectious diseases.",,"Infectious diseases afflict human beings since ancient times. We can classify the infectious disease in two principal types: the emerging diseases, that are caused by new pathogens, and the re-emerging diseases, due to a new spread of a known pathogen. Both types can then be subdivided in natural, accidental or intentional spreads. The risk associated to infectious diseases strongly increased in the last decades, especially because of the globalisation, which leads to a denser and more efficient link between nations, involving that a local infectious may easily spread worldwide, such as the SARS-CoV-2 in 2019-2020. The development of new methods to predict the spread of diseases is crucial. However, sometimes the variables are too many that classical algorithms fail in the prediction. Aim of this work is to investigate the use of an ensemble of recurrent neural networks for disease prediction, using real flu's data to train and develop an instrument with the capability to determine the future flues. Two different types of study have been conducted. The first study investigates the influence of the neural network architecture, and it has been performed using 12 seasons to train the model and 3 seasons to test it. The second test aims to investigate the number of seasons needed to have a good prediction for future ones. The results demonstrated that this approach could ensure very high performances also with simple architectures. The ensemble approach allows to have information about the uncertainty of the prediction, allowing also to take countermeasures as a function of that value. In the future, the use of this approach may be applied to many other types of disease.",Epidemic Forecasting

Occupancy modeling uses repeated sampling to estimate probability of false negative results, like those linked to rapid tests, for generating unbiased prevalence estimates. METHODS: We developed a simulation study to estimate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence using rapid, low-sensitivity, low-cost tests and slower, high-sensitivity, higher cost tests across a range of disease prevalence and sampling strategies. RESULTS: Occupancy modeling overcame the low sensitivity of rapid tests to generate prevalence estimates comparable to more accurate, slower tests. Moreover, minimal repeated sampling was required to offset low test sensitivity at low disease prevalence (0.1%), when rapid testing is most critical for informing disease management. CONCLUSIONS: Occupancy modeling enables the use of rapid tests to provide accurate, affordable, real-time estimates of the prevalence of emerging infectious diseases like SARS-CoV-2.",Diagnosis;Epidemic Forecasting

We first prove that the infection-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable with condition R0<1 and the positive equilibrium is uniformly persistent when the condition R0>1. By using the COVID-19 data in India, we then give numerical simulations to illustrate our results and carry out some sensitivity analysis.

During decision-making, policymakers consider an estimate of the effective reproduction number Rt, which is the expected number of secondary infections spread by a single infected individual. OBJECTIVE: We propose a simple method for estimating the time-varying infection rate and the Rt. METHODS: We used a sliding window approach with a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model. We estimated the infection rate from the reported cases over a 7-day window to obtain a continuous estimation of Rt. A proposed adaptive SIR (aSIR) model was applied to analyze the data at the state and county levels. RESULTS: The aSIR model showed an excellent fit for the number of reported COVID-19 cases, and the 1-day forecast mean absolute prediction error was <2.6% across all states. However, the 7-day forecast mean absolute prediction error approached 16.2% and strongly overestimated the number of cases when the Rt was rapidly decreasing. The maximal Rt displayed a wide range of 2.0 to 4.5 across all states, with the highest values for New York (4.4) and Michigan (4.5). We found that the aSIR model can rapidly adapt to an increase in the number of tests and an associated increase in the reported cases of infection. Our results also suggest that intensive testing may be an effective method of reducing Rt. CONCLUSIONS: The aSIR model provides a simple and accurate computational tool for continuous Rt estimation and evaluation of the efficacy of mitigation measures.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Hospital-specific forecasts of demand that provide prediction intervals, rather than point estimates, may facilitate better managerial decisions, especially when demand overage and underage are associated with high, asymmetric costs. Regional point forecasts of patient demand are commonly available, e.g., for the number of people requiring hospitalization due to an epidemic such as COVID-19. However, even in this common setting, no probabilistic, consistent, computationally tractable forecast is available for the fraction of patients in a region that a particular institution should expect. We introduce such a forecast, DICE (Demand Intervals from Consistent Estimators). We describe its development and deployment at an academic medical center in California during the 'second wave' of COVID-19 in the Unite States. We show that DICE is consistent under mild assumptions and suitable for use with perfect, biased and unbiased regional forecasts. We evaluate its performance on empirical data from a large academic medical center as well as on synthetic data.",Epidemic Forecasting

To develop adequate responses, they need accurate models for the spread of the disease. Using least squares, we fitted Bertalanffy-Putter (BP) trend curves to data about the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 from 49 countries and provinces where the peak of the first wave had been passed. BP-models achieved excellent fits (R-squared above 99%) to all data. Using them to smoothen the data, in the median one could forecast that the final count (asymptotic limit) of infections and fatalities would be 2.48 times (95% confidence limits 2.42-2.6) and 2.67 times (2.39-2.765) the total count at the respective peak (inflection point). By comparison, using logistic growth would evaluate this ratio as 2.00 for all data. The case fatality rate, defined as the quotient of the asymptotic limits of fatalities and confirmed infections, was in the median 4.85% (confidence limits 4.4%-6.5%). Our result supports the strategies of governments that kept the epidemic peak low, as then in the median fewer infections and fewer fatalities could be expected.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Using Bayesian model-based phylodynamic methods, we estimate a mean basic reproduction number (R 0) of 3.4 (95% highest posterior density interval: 2.1-5.2) in Weifang, and a mean effective reproduction number (Rt) that falls below 1 on 4 February.

The model is sufficiently rich to incorporate specific characteristics of the novel coronavirus, to capture the impact of undetected, asymptomatic and super-diffusive individuals, and especially to take into account time-varying counter-measures and detection efforts. Yet, it is simple enough to allow scalable and efficient computation of the temporal evolution of the epidemic, and exploration of what-if scenarios. Compared to traditional compartmental models, our approach allows a more faithful description of virus specific features, such as distributions for the time spent in stages, which is crucial when the time-scale of control (e.g., mobility restrictions) is comparable to the lifetime of a single infection. We apply the model to the first and second wave of COVID-19 in Italy, shedding light onto several effects related to mobility restrictions introduced by the government, and to the effectiveness of contact tracing and mass testing performed by the national health service.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

This study presents the vital relationship between weather seasonality, airborne virus transmission, and pandemic outbreaks over a whole year. Using the data obtained from high-fidelity multi-phase, fluid dynamics simulations, we calculate the concentration rate of Coronavirus particles in contaminated saliva droplets and use it to derive a new Airborne Infection Rate (AIR) index. Combining the simplest form of an epidemiological model, the susceptible-infected-recovered, and the AIR index, we show through data evidence how weather seasonality induces two outbreaks per year, as it is observed with the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. We present the results for the number of cases and transmission rates for three cities, New York, Paris, and Rio de Janeiro. The results suggest that two pandemic outbreaks per year are inevitable because they are directly linked to what we call weather seasonality. The pandemic outbreaks are associated with changes in temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed independently of the particular season. We propose that epidemiological models must incorporate climate effects through the AIR index.",Epidemic Forecasting;Transmission

Furthermore, we study the sensitivity of the parameters and use the data from Tennessee state (as a case study) to discuss identifiability of the parameters of the model. The non-negative parameters in the model are obtained by solving inverse problems with empirical data from California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. The basic reproduction number is seen to be slightly above the critical value of one suggesting that stricter measures such as the use of face-masks, social distancing, contact tracing, and even longer stay-at-home orders need to be enforced in order to mitigate the spread of the virus.

Soon world health organization has declared contagious coronavirus disease (a.k.a. COVID-19) as a global pandemic in the month of March 2020.

It is believed that under-reporting is a relevant factor in determining the actual mortality rate and, if not considered, can cause significant misinformation. Therefore, this work aims to estimate the under-reporting of cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Brazilian states using data from the InfoGripe. InfoGripe targets notifications of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). The methodology is based on the combination of data analytics (event detection methods) and time series modeling (inertia and novelty concepts) over hospitalized SARI cases. The estimate of real cases of the disease, called novelty, is calculated by comparing the difference in SARI cases in 2020 (after COVID-19) with the total expected cases in recent years (2016-2019). The expected cases are derived from a seasonal exponential moving average. The results show that under-reporting rates vary significantly between states and that there are no general patterns for states in the same region in Brazil. The states of Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso have the highest rates of under-reporting of cases. The rate of under-reporting of deaths is high in the Rio Grande do Sul and the Minas Gerais. This work can be highlighted for the combination of data analytics and time series modeling. Our calculation of under-reporting rates based on SARI is conservative and better characterized by deaths than for cases.",Epidemic Forecasting

As time evolves in the present pandemic, it appears more and more clearly that a clustered dynamics is a key element of the description. This means that the disease rapidly evolves within spatially localized networks, that diffuse and eventually create new clusters. We improve upon the simplest possible compartmental model, the SIR model, by adding an additional compartment associated with the clustered individuals. This sophistication is compatible with more advanced compartmental models and allows, at the lowest level of complexity, to leverage the well-mixedness assumption. The so-obtained SBIR model takes into account the effect of inhomogeneity on epidemic spreading, and compares satisfactorily with results on the pandemic propagation in a number of European countries, during and immediately after lock-down. Especially, the decay exponent of the number of new cases after the first peak of the epidemic is captured without the need to vary the coefficients of the model with time. We show that this decay exponent is directly determined by the diffusion of the ensemble of clustered individuals and can be related to a global reproduction number, that overrides the classical, local reproduction number.",Epidemic Forecasting
33743847,Vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study.,,"BACKGROUND: The dynamics of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 are complicated by age-dependent factors, changing levels of infection, and the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as the perceived risk declines, necessitating the use of mathematical models. Our aims were to use epidemiological data from the UK together with estimates of vaccine efficacy to predict the possible long-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 under the planned vaccine rollout. METHODS: In this study, we used a mathematical model structured by age and UK region, fitted to a range of epidemiological data in the UK, which incorporated the planned rollout of a two-dose vaccination programme (doses 12 weeks apart, protection onset 14 days after vaccination). We assumed default vaccine uptake of 95% in those aged 80 years and older, 85% in those aged 50-79 years, and 75% in those aged 18-49 years, and then varied uptake optimistically and pessimistically. Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease was assumed to be 88% on the basis of Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines being administered in the UK, and protection against infection was varied from 0% to 85%. We considered the combined interaction of the UK vaccination programme with multiple potential future relaxations (or removals) of NPIs, to predict the reproduction number (R) and pattern of daily deaths and hospital admissions due to COVID-19 from January, 2021, to January, 2024. FINDINGS: We estimate that vaccination alone is insufficient to contain the outbreak. In the absence of NPIs, even with our most optimistic assumption that the vaccine will prevent 85% of infections, we estimate R to be 1.58 (95% credible intervals [CI] 1.36-1.84) once all eligible adults have been offered both doses of the vaccine. Under the default uptake scenario, removal of all NPIs once the vaccination programme is complete is predicted to lead to 21 400 deaths (95% CI 1400-55 100) due to COVID-19 for a vaccine that prevents 85% of infections, although this number increases to 96 700 deaths (51 800-173 200) if the vaccine only prevents 60% of infections. Although vaccination substantially reduces total deaths, it only provides partial protection for the individual; we estimate that, for the default uptake scenario and 60% protection against infection, 48.3% (95% CI 48.1-48.5) and 16.0% (15.7-16.3) of deaths will be in individuals who have received one or two doses of the vaccine, respectively. INTERPRETATION: For all vaccination scenarios we investigated, our predictions highlight the risks associated with early or rapid relaxation of NPIs. Although novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 offer a potential exit strategy for the pandemic, success is highly contingent on the precise vaccine properties and population uptake, both of which need to be carefully monitored.

Upon optimizing the model parameters in the learning phase of the analysis using actual infection data from a period of the first 30 days, we then find that the model output closely tracks the actual data for the next 15 days. Next, we introduce a control input into the model to represent the Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention of social distancing. Implementing the control using two distinct schemes, we find that in both cases the control input is able to significantly mitigate the infection spread. In addition to opening a novel pathway towards the characterization, analysis and implementation of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions across multiple geographical scales using Control frameworks, our results highlight the importance of first-principles based PDE models in understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of epidemics triggered by novel pathogens.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We use the statistics of confirmed cases of China excl. Hubei. Also the daily data on travel activity within China was utilized, in order to determine the actual numerical development of the infected people in Wuhan City and Hubei Province.

Particularly given the rapid pace of model development, evaluation, and integration with decision making in emergency situations, it is necessary to understand the benefits and pitfalls of transmission models. We review and highlight key aspects of the history of infectious disease dynamic models, the role of rigorous testing and evaluation, the integration with data, and the successful application of models to guide public health.

The total peak number of cumulative cases, new cases, and the maximum number of cumulative cases in the world with complete intervention implemented 4 weeks later than the beginning date (March 16th, 2020) reached 75,249,909, 10,086,085, and 255,392,154, respectively.

The rate was then combined with estimates of the distribution of the generation interval as reconstructed from the literature. RESULTS: Despite the possible unreliability of some official statistics about COVID-19, the spread of the disease appears to be remarkably similar in most European countries, allowing us to estimate an average R0 in Western Europe of 2.2 (95% CI: 1.9-2.6).

After a slowdown in the epidemic, on 6 May, 2020, the regulatory authorities decided to relax the implemented measures. However, the epidemiological situation soon worsened again. As of 7 February, 2021, a total of 406,352 cases of SARSCov-2 infection have been reported in Serbia, 4,112 deaths caused by COVID-19. In order to better understand the epidemic dynamics and predict possible outcomes, we have developed an adaptive mathematical model SEAIHRDS (S-susceptible, E-exposed, A-asymptomatic, I-infected, H-hospitalized, R-recovered, D-dead due to COVID-19 infection, S-susceptible). The model can be used to simulate various scenarios of the implemented intervention measures and calculate possible epidemic outcomes, including the necessary hospital capacities. Considering promising results regarding the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, the model is extended to simulate vaccination among different population strata. The findings from various simulation scenarios have shown that, with implementation of strict measures of contact reduction, it is possible to control COVID-19 and reduce number of deaths. The findings also show that limiting effective contacts within the most susceptible population strata merits a special attention. However, the findings also show that the disease has a potential to remain in the population for a long time, likely with a seasonal pattern. If a vaccine, with efficacy equal or higher than 65%, becomes available it could help to significantly slow down or completely stop circulation of the virus in human population. The effects of vaccination depend primarily on: 1. Efficacy of available vaccine(s), 2. Prioritization of the population categories for vaccination, and 3. Overall vaccination coverage of the population, assuming that the vaccine(s) develop solid immunity in vaccinated individuals. With expected basic reproduction number of Ro=2.46 and vaccine efficacy of 68%, an 87% coverage would be sufficient to stop the virus circulation.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Treatment

In the present article, we have developed a mediative fuzzy correlation technique based on the parameters for COVID-19 patients from different parts of India. The proposed mediative fuzzy correlation technique provides the relation between the increments of COVID-19 positive patients in terms of the passage of increment with respect to time. The peaks of infected cases in connection with the other condition are estimated from the available data. The mediative fuzzy logic mathematical model can be utilized to find a good fit or a contradictory model for any pandemic model.

And, the disease caused by the virus is named the new coronavirus disease 2019 and it will be abbreviated as 2019-nCoV and COVID-19. As of January 30, 2020, the WHO classified this epidemic as a global health emergency (Chung et al. in Radiology 295(1):202-207, 2020). It is an international real-life problem. Due to deaths, globally everyone is under fear. Now, it is the responsibility of researchers to give hope to the people. In this article, we aim to better protect people and general pandemic preparedness by predicting the lifetime of the disease-causing virus using three mathematical models. This article deals with a complex real-life problem people face all over the world, an international real-life problem. The main focus is on the USA due to large infection and death due to coronavirus and thereby the life of every individual is uncertain. The death counts of the USA from February 29 to April 22, 2020, are used in this article as a data set. The death counts of the USA are fitted by the solutions of three mathematical models and a solution to an international problem is achieved. Based on the death rate, the lifetime of the coronavirus COVID-19 is predicted as 1464.76 days from February 29, 2020. That is, after March 2024 there will be no death in the USA due to COVID-19 if everyone follows the guidelines of WHO and the advice of healthcare workers. People and government can get prepared for this situation and many lives can be saved. It is the contribution of soft computing.

According to a report, comorbidity enhances the risk factors with complications of COVID-19. Here, we propose and explore a mathematical framework to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 with comorbidity. Within this framework, the model is calibrated by using new daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in India. The qualitative properties of the model and the stability of feasible equilibrium are studied. The model experiences the scenario of backward bifurcation by parameter regime accounting for progress in susceptibility to acquire infection by comorbidity individuals. The endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable if recruitment of comorbidity becomes higher without acquiring the infection. Moreover, a larger backward bifurcation regime indicates the possibility of more infection in susceptible individuals. A dynamics in the mean fluctuation of the force of infection is investigated with different parameter regimes. A significant correlation is established between the force of infection and corresponding Shannon entropy under the same parameters, which provides evidence that infection reaches a significant proportion of the susceptible.",Epidemic Forecasting;Transmission

Objective: Our objective was to create a repeatable modeling process to identify regional population centers with pandemic vulnerability. Methods: Using readily available COVID-19 and socioeconomic variable data sets, we used stepwise linear regression techniques to build predictive models during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The models were validated later in the pandemic timeline using actual COVID-19 mortality rates in high population density states. The mean sample size was 43 and ranged from 8 (Connecticut) to 82 (Michigan). Results: The New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania models provided the strongest predictions of top counties in densely populated states with a high likelihood of disproportionate COVID-19 mortality rates. For all of these models, P values were less than .05. Conclusions: The models have been shared with the Department of Health Commissioners of each of these states with strong model predictions as input into a much needed ""pandemic playbook"" for local health care agencies in allocating medical testing and treatment resources.

33707546,Determining the level of social distancing necessary to avoid future COVID-19 epidemic waves: a modelling study for North East London.,,"Determining the level of social distancing, quantified here as the reduction in daily number of social contacts per person, i.e. the daily contact rate, needed to maintain control of the COVID-19 epidemic and not exceed acute bed capacity in case of future epidemic waves, is important for future planning of relaxing of strict social distancing measures. This work uses mathematical modelling to simulate the levels of COVID-19 in North East London (NEL) and inform the level of social distancing necessary to protect the public and the healthcare demand from future COVID-19 waves. We used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model describing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in NEL, calibrated to data on hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19, hospital discharges and in-hospital deaths in NEL during the first epidemic wave. To account for the uncertainty in both the infectiousness period and the proportion of symptomatic infection, we simulated nine scenarios for different combinations of infectiousness period (1, 3 and 5 days) and proportion of symptomatic infection (70%, 50% and 25% of all infections). Across all scenarios, the calibrated model was used to assess the risk of occurrence and predict the strength and timing of a second COVID-19 wave under varying levels of daily contact rate from July 04, 2020. Specifically, the daily contact rate required to suppress the epidemic and prevent a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, and the daily contact rate required to stay within the acute bed capacity of the NEL system without any additional intervention measures after July 2020, were determined across the nine different scenarios. Our results caution against a full relaxing of the lockdown later in 2020, predicting that a return to pre-COVID-19 levels of social contact from July 04, 2020, would induce a second wave up to eight times the original wave. With different levels of ongoing social distancing, future resurgence can be avoided, or the strength of the resurgence can be mitigated. Keeping the daily contact rate lower than 5 or 6, depending on scenarios, can prevent an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, could keep the effective reproduction number Re below 1 and a secondary COVID-19 wave may be avoided in NEL. A daily contact rate between 6 and 7, across scenarios, is likely to increase Re above 1 and result in a secondary COVID-19 wave with significantly increased COVID-19 cases and associated deaths, but with demand for hospital-based care remaining within the bed capacity of the NEL health and care system. In contrast, an increase in daily contact rate above 8 to 9, depending on scenarios, will likely exceed the acute bed capacity in NEL and may potentially require additional lockdowns. This scenario is associated with significantly increased COVID-19 cases and deaths, and acute COVID-19 care demand is likely to require significant scaling down of the usual operation of the health and care system and should be avoided. Our findings suggest that to avoid future COVID-19 waves and to stay within the acute bed capacity of the NEL health and care system, maintaining social distancing in NEL is advised with a view to limiting the average number of social interactions in the population. Increasing the level of social interaction beyond the limits described in this work could result in future COVID-19 waves that will likely exceed the acute bed capacity in the system, and depending on the strength of the resurgence may require additional lockdown measures.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

33705424,An epidemic model for non-first-order transmission kinetics.,,"Compartmental models in epidemiology characterize the spread of an infectious disease by formulating ordinary differential equations to quantify the rate of disease progression through subpopulations defined by the Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) scheme. The classic rate law central to the SIR compartmental models assumes that the rate of transmission is first order regarding the infectious agent. The current study demonstrates that this assumption does not always hold and provides a theoretical rationale for a more general rate law, inspired by mixed-order chemical reaction kinetics, leading to a modified mathematical model for non-first-order kinetics. Using observed data from 127 countries during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrated that the modified epidemic model is more realistic than the classic, first-order-kinetics based model. We discuss two coefficients associated with the modified epidemic model: transmission rate constant k and transmission reaction order n. While k finds utility in evaluating the effectiveness of control measures due to its responsiveness to external factors, n is more closely related to the intrinsic properties of the epidemic agent, including reproductive ability. The rate law for the modified compartmental SIR model is generally applicable to mixed-kinetics disease transmission with heterogeneous transmission mechanisms. By analyzing early-stage epidemic data, this modified epidemic model may be instrumental in providing timely insight into a new epidemic and developing control measures at the beginning of an outbreak.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

BACKGROUND: Following the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, a drop in blood donation has been observed. It is crucial to determine the actual number of potential SARS-CoV-2-positive donors to define the measures and ensure adequate blood supply. METHODS: The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, calculated on the general population, was applied to the donor population by estimating the number of positive subjects. The calculation model was validated by the linear interpolation method. The number of blood units actually discarded based on post-donation information was also taken into account. RESULTS: Three months after the outbreak, 5322 donors were estimated to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were therefore potentially excluded from donation. A total of units of blood components were discarded following post donation information. The estimated number of donors deceased (180) and the number of clinically recovered individuals in the same period was also considered.

To address public concerns, we measured the baseline incidence rates of major conditions potentially related to vaccine-related adverse events (VAEs). We aimed to provide a basis for evaluating VAEs and verifying causality. METHODS: Conditions of interest were selected from the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System Table of Reportable Events and a recent report from a European consortium on vaccine surveillance. We used the National Health Insurance Service database in Korea to identify the monthly numbers of cases with these conditions. Data from January 2006 to June 2020 were included. Prediction models were constructed from the observed incidences using an autoregressive integrated moving average. We predicted the incidences of the conditions and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for January through December 2021. In addition, subgroup analysis for the expected vaccination population was conducted. RESULTS: Mean values (95% CIs) of the predicted monthly incidence of vasovagal syncope, anaphylaxis, brachial neuritis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Bell's palsy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, encephalopathy, optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and systemic lupus erythematosus in 2021 were 23.89 (19.81-27.98), 4.72 (3.83-5.61), 57.62 (51.37-63.88), 0.03 (0.01-0.04), 8.58 (7.90-9.26), 0.26 (0.18-0.34), 2.13 (1.42-2.83), 1.65 (1.17-2.13), 0.19 (0.14-0.25), 0.75 (0.61-0.90), and 3.40 (2.79-4.01) cases per 100,000 respectively.

To ensure continued response to the epidemic is most effective, it is imperative to better understand both retrospectively and prospectively the geographical evolution of COVID-19 caseloads and deaths at small-area resolution, identify localised areas in space-time at significantly higher risk, quantify the impact of changes in localised population mobility (or movement) on caseloads, identify localised risk factors for increased mortality and project the likely course of the epidemic at high spatial resolution in coming weeks. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical space-time SEIR model to assess the spatiotemporal variability of COVID-19 caseloads (transmission) and deaths at small-area scale in England [Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA), 6791 units] and by week (using observed data from week 5 to 34 of 2020), including key determinants, the modelled transmission dynamics and spatial-temporal random effects. We also estimate the number of cases and deaths at small-area resolution with uncertainty projected forward in time by MSOA (up to week 51 of 2020), the impact mobility reductions (and subsequent easing) have had on COVID-19 caseloads and quantify the impact of key socio-demographic risk factors on COVID-19 related mortality risk by MSOA. Reductions in population mobility during the course of the first lockdown had a significant impact on the reduction of COVID-19 caseloads across England, however local authorities have had a varied rate of reduction in population movement which our model suggest has substantially impacted the geographic heterogeneity in caseloads at small-area scale. The steady gain in population mobility, observed from late April, appears to have contributed to a slowdown in caseload reductions towards late June and subsequent start of the second wave. MSOA with higher proportions of elderly (70+ years of age) and elderly living in deprivation, both with very distinct geographic distributions, have a significantly elevated COVID-19 mortality rates. While non-pharmaceutical interventions (that is, reductions in population mobility and social distancing) had a profound impact on the trajectory of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in England, increased population mobility appears to have significantly contributed to the second wave. A number of contiguous small-areas appear to be at a significant elevated risk of high COVID-19 transmission, many of which are also at increased risk for higher mortality rates. A geographically staggered re-introduction of intensified social distancing measures is advised and limited cross MSOA movement if the magnitude and geographic extent of the second wave is to be reduced.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The model fit the reported data well (R(2) = 0.593, P < 0.001). The Reff of COVID-19 before and after February 1, 2020 was 1.64 and 0.05, respectively. Without the intervention taken on February 1, 2020, the predicted cases would have reached a peak of 177,011 on October 22, 2020 (284 days from the first case). The projected number of cases until the end of the outbreak (on October 9, 2021) would have been 17,129,367, with a total attack rate of 63.66%. Based on the comparison between the predicted incidence of the model and the actual incidence, the comprehensive intervention measures implemented in Jilin Province on February 1 reduced the incidence of cases by 99.99%. Therefore, according to the current measures and implementation efforts, Jilin Province can achieve good control of the virus's spread. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has a moderate transmissibility in Jilin Province, China. The interventions implemented in the province had proven effective; increasing social distancing and a rapid response by the prevention and control system will help control the spread of the disease.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

As of 12.44 GMT on 15 January 2021, it has produced 93,640,296 cases and 2,004,984 deaths. The use of mathematical modelling was applied in Italy, Spain, and UK to help in the prediction of this pandemic. We used equations from general and reduced logistic models to describe the epidemic development phenomenon and the trend over time. We extracted this information from the Italian Ministry of Health, the Spanish Ministry of Health, Consumer Affairs, and Social Welfare, and the UK Statistics Authority from 3 February to 30 April 2020. We estimated that, from the seriousness of the phenomenon, the consequent pathology, and the lethal outcomes, the COVID-19 trend relate to the same classic laws that govern epidemics and their evolution. The curve d(t) helps to obtain information on the duration of the epidemic phenomenon, as its evolution is related to the efficiency and timeliness of the system, control, diagnosis, and treatment. In fact, the analysis of this curve, after acquiring the data of the first three weeks, also favors the advantage to formulate forecast hypotheses on the progress of the epidemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33667241,"Control strategies for COVID-19 epidemic with vaccination, shield immunity and quarantine: A metric temporal logic approach.",,"Ever since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, various public health control strategies have been proposed and tested against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We study three specific COVID-19 epidemic control models: the susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered (SEIR) model with vaccination control; the SEIR model with shield immunity control; and the susceptible, un-quarantined infected, quarantined infected, confirmed infected (SUQC) model with quarantine control. We express the control requirement in metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas (a type of formal specification languages) which can specify the expected control outcomes such as ""the deaths from the infection should never exceed one thousand per day within the next three months"" or ""the population immune from the disease should eventually exceed 200 thousand within the next 100 to 120 days"". We then develop methods for synthesizing control strategies with MTL specifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to systematically synthesize control strategies based on the COVID-19 epidemic models with formal specifications. We provide simulation results in three different case studies: vaccination control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; shield immunity control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; and quarantine control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Wuhan, China. The results show that the proposed synthesis approach can generate control inputs such that the time-varying numbers of individuals in each category (e.g., infectious, immune) satisfy the MTL specifications. The results also show that early intervention is essential in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, and more control effort is needed for more stringent MTL specifications. For example, based on the model in Lombardy, Italy, achieving less than 100 deaths per day and 10000 total deaths within 100 days requires 441.7% more vaccination control effort than achieving less than 1000 deaths per day and 50000 total deaths within 100 days.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Serological tests that identify past infection can be used to estimate cumulative incidence, but the relative accuracy and robustness of various sampling strategies have been unclear. We developed a flexible framework that integrates uncertainty from test characteristics, sample size, and heterogeneity in seroprevalence across subpopulations to compare estimates from sampling schemes. Using the same framework and making the assumption that seropositivity indicates immune protection, we propagated estimates and uncertainty through dynamical models to assess uncertainty in the epidemiological parameters needed to evaluate public health interventions and found that sampling schemes informed by demographics and contact networks outperform uniform sampling. The framework can be adapted to optimize serosurvey design given test characteristics and capacity, population demography, sampling strategy, and modeling approach, and can be tailored to support decision-making around introducing or removing interventions.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33664280,On topological properties of COVID-19: predicting and assessing pandemic risk with network statistics.,,"The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused more than 80 million confirmed infected cases and more than 1.8 million people died as of 31 December 2020. While it is essential to quantify risk and characterize transmission dynamics in closed populations using Susceptible-Infection-Recovered modeling, the investigation of the effect from worldwide pandemic cannot be neglected. This study proposes a network analysis to assess global pandemic risk by linking 164 countries in pandemic networks, where links between countries were specified by the level of 'co-movement' of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases. More countries showing increase in the COVID-19 cases simultaneously will signal the pandemic prevalent over the world. The network density, clustering coefficients, and assortativity in the pandemic networks provide early warning signals of the pandemic in late February 2020. We propose a preparedness pandemic risk score for prediction and a severity risk score for pandemic control. The preparedness risk score contributed by countries in Asia is between 25% and 50% most of the time after February and America contributes around 40% in July 2020. The high preparedness risk contribution implies the importance of travel restrictions between those countries. The severity risk score of America and Europe contribute around 90% in December 2020, signifying that the control of COVID-19 is still worrying in America and Europe. We can keep track of the pandemic situation in each country using an online dashboard to update the pandemic risk scores and contributions.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The model itself is a compartmental model in which each compartment is divided into a number of age-groups. The parameters of the model are estimated using an optimisation scheme and some known results from the theory of monotone systems such that the model output agrees with some collected data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. To highlight the strengths of this framework, a few case studies are presented in which different populations are subjected to different containment strategies. They include cases in which the containment policies switch between scenarios with different levels of severity. Then a case study on herd immunity due to vaccination is presented. And then it is shown how we can use this framework to optimally distribute a limited number of vaccine units in a given population to maximise their impact and reduce the total number of infectious individuals.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

High-risk locations for transmission of the virus are public transportations, one of which is the train, because many people take turns in or together inside. One of the policies of the government is physical distancing, then followed by large-scale social restrictions. The keys to the policy are distance and movement. The most famous transportation used for the movement of people among provinces on Java is train. Here a Generalized Space Time Autoregressive (GSTAR) model is applied to forecast infected case of 2019-nCoV for 6 provinces in Java. The specialty of this model is the weight matrix as a tool to see spatial dependence. Here, the modified Inverse Distance Weight matrix is proposed as a combination of the population ratio factor with the average distance of an inter-provincial train on the island of Java. The GSTAR model (1; 1) can capture the pattern of daily cases increase in 2019-nCoV, evidenced by representative results, especially in East Java, where the increase in cases is strongly influenced by other provinces on the island of Java. Based on the Mean Squares of Residuals, it is obtained that the modified matrix gives better result in both estimating (in-sample) and forecasting (out-sample) compare with the ordinary matrix.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33658593,COVID-19: a simple statistical model for predicting intensive care unit load in exponential phases of the disease.,,"One major bottleneck in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the limited number of critical care beds. Due to the dynamic development of infections and the time lag between when patients are infected and when a proportion of them enters an intensive care unit (ICU), the need for future intensive care can easily be underestimated. To infer future ICU load from reported infections, we suggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2) allows for making predictions depending on different future growth of infections. We have evaluated our model for three heavily affected regions in Europe, namely Berlin (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), and Madrid (Spain). Before extensive containment measures made an impact, we first estimate the region-specific model parameters, namely ICU rate, time lag between infection, and ICU admission as well as length of stay in ICU. Whereas for Berlin, an ICU rate of 6%, a time lag of 6 days, and a stay of 12 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data, for Lombardy and Madrid the ICU rate was higher (18% and 15%) and the time lag (0 and 3 days) and the stay in ICU (3 and 8 days) shorter. The region-specific models are then used to predict future ICU load assuming either a continued exponential phase with varying growth rates (0-15%) or linear growth. By keeping the growth rates flexible, this model allows for taking into account the potential effect of diverse containment measures. Thus, the model can help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity depending on future growth. A sensitivity analysis for an extended time period shows that the proposed model is particularly useful for exponential phases of the disease.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The VECM provided a good fit to Census and very good forecasting performance as assessed by hypothesis tests and mean absolute percentage prediction error. Although our study and model have limitations, we have conducted a broad and insightful search for candidate Internet variables and employed rigorous statistical methods.

Using a variety of statistical and dynamic modeling approaches, we estimate that this variant has a 43 to 90% (range of 95% credible intervals, 38 to 130%) higher reproduction number than preexisting variants. A fitted two-strain dynamic transmission model shows that VOC 202012/01 will lead to large resurgences of COVID-19 cases. Without stringent control measures, including limited closure of educational institutions and a greatly accelerated vaccine rollout, COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths across England in the first 6 months of 2021 were projected to exceed those in 2020.

Such models rely on virus- and disease characteristics of which most are uncertain or even unknown for SARS-CoV-2. This study addresses the validity of various assumptions using an epidemiological simulation model. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, we show that multiple scenarios all lead to realistic numbers of deaths and ICU admissions, two observable and verifiable metrics. Second, we test the sensitivity of estimates for the number of infected and immune individuals, and show that these vary strongly between scenarios. Note that the amount of variation measured in this study is merely a lower bound: epidemiological modeling contains uncertainty on more parameters than the four in this study, and including those as well would lead to an even larger set of possible scenarios. As the level of infection and immunity among the population are particularly important for policy makers, further research on virus and disease progression characteristics is essential. Until that time, epidemiological modeling studies cannot give conclusive results and should come with a careful analysis of several scenarios on virus- and disease characteristics.",Epidemic Forecasting

Non-local fractional operators are one of the most efficient tools in order to understand the dynamics of the disease spread. For this purpose, we intend as an attempt at investigating the fractional COVID-19 model through Caputo operator with order chi in ( 0 , 1 ) . Employing the fixed point theorem, it is shown that the solutions of the proposed fractional model are determined to satisfy the existence and uniqueness conditions under the Caputo derivative. On the other hand, its iterative solutions are indicated by making use of the Laplace transform of the Caputo fractional operator. Also, we establish the stability criteria for the fractional COVID-19 model via the fixed point theorem. The invariant region in which all solutions of the fractional model under investigation are positive is determined as the non-negative hyperoctant R + 7 . Moreover, we perform the parameter estimation of the COVID-19 model by utilizing the non-linear least squares curve fitting method. The sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number R 0 c is carried out to determine the effects of the proposed fractional model's parameters on the spread of the disease.

Disease transmission may be modeled as compartmental models, in which the population under study is divided into compartments and has assumptions about the nature and time rate of transfer from one compartment to another. Usually, they are composed of a system of ordinary differential equations in time. A class of such models considers the Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased populations, the SEIRD model. However, these models do not always account for the movement of individuals from one region to another. In this work, we extend the formulation of SEIRD compartmental models to diffusion-reaction systems of partial differential equations to capture the continuous spatio-temporal dynamics of COVID-19. Since the virus spread is not only through diffusion, we introduce a source term to the equation system, representing exposed people who return from travel. We also add the possibility of anisotropic non-homogeneous diffusion. We implement the whole model in libMesh, an open finite element library that provides a framework for multiphysics, considering adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening. Therefore, the model can represent several spatial scales, adapting the resolution to the disease dynamics. We verify our model with standard SEIRD models and show several examples highlighting the present model's new capabilities.",Epidemic Forecasting

Remarkably, creating stock-flow diagrams is the same process as creating the equivalent differential equations. Yet, its visual nature makes the process simple and intuitive. We demonstrate the simplicity of system dynamics by applying it to epidemic models including a model of COVID-19 mutation. We then discuss the ease with which far more complex models can be produced by implementing a model comprising eight differential equations of a Chikungunya epidemic from the literature.

For large tau, the disease model is described by a statistical field theory. Hence, the phases of the underlying field theory characterise the disease dynamics: (i) a pandemic phase and (ii) a response regime. The statistical field theory provides an upper bound of the peak rate of infected agents. An effective control strategy needs to aim to keep the disease in the response regime (no 'second' wave). The model is tested at the quantitative level using an idealised disease network. The model excellently describes the epidemic spread of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China.

Despite several control efforts invested in breaking the transmission chain of the disease, there is a rise in the number of reported infected and death cases around the world. Hence, there is the need for a mathematical model that can reliably describe the real nature of the transmission behaviour and control of the disease. This study presents an appropriately developed deterministic compartmental model to investigate the effect of different pharmaceutical (treatment therapies) and non-pharmaceutical (particularly, human personal protection and contact tracing and testing on the exposed individuals) control measures on COVID-19 population dynamics in Malaysia. The data from daily reported cases of COVID-19 between 3 March and 31 December 2020 are used to parameterize the model. The basic reproduction number of the model is estimated. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effect of various control combination strategies involving the use of personal protection, contact tracing and testing, and treatment control measures on the disease spread. Numerical simulations reveal that the implementation of each strategy analysed can significantly reduce COVID-19 incidence and prevalence in the population. However, the results of effectiveness analysis suggest that a strategy that combines both the pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical control measures averts the highest number of infections in the population.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The reproduction number of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been found to vary over time, potentially being influenced by a multitude of factors such as varying control strategies, changes in public awareness and reaction or, as a recent study suggests, sensitivity to temperature or humidity changes. To take into consideration these constantly evolving factors, the paper introduces a time dynamic, humidity-dependent SEIR-type extended epidemiological model with range-defined parameters. Using primarily the historical data of the outbreak from Northern and Southern Italy and with the help of stochastic global optimization algorithms, we are able to determine a model parameter estimation that provides a high-quality fit to the data. The time-dependent contact rate showed a quick drop to a value slightly below 2. Applying the model for the COVID-19 outbreak in the northern region of Italy, we obtained parameters that suggest a slower shrinkage of the contact rate to a value slightly above 4. These findings indicate that model fitting and validation, even on a limited amount of available data, can provide useful insights and projections, uncover aspects that upon improvement might help mitigate the disease spreading.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

This study was conducted to guide the Qatari national response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. The study investigated the epidemic's time-course, forecasted health care needs, predicted the impact of social and physical distancing restrictions, and rationalized and justified easing of restrictions. Methods: An age-structured deterministic model was constructed to describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and disease progression throughout the population. Results: The enforced social and physical distancing interventions flattened the epidemic curve, reducing the peaks for incidence, prevalence, acute-care hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations by 87%, 86%, 76%, and 78%, respectively. The daily number of new infections was predicted to peak at 12 750 on May 23, and active-infection prevalence was predicted to peak at 3.2% on May 25. Daily acute-care and ICU-care hospital admissions and occupancy were forecast accurately and precisely. By October 15, 2020, the basic reproduction number R0 had varied between 1.07-2.78, and 50.8% of the population were estimated to have been infected (1.43 million infections). The proportion of actual infections diagnosed was estimated at 11.6%. Applying the concept of Rt tuning, gradual easing of restrictions was rationalized and justified to start on June 15, 2020, when Rt declined to 0.7, to buffer the increased interpersonal contact with easing of restrictions and to minimize the risk of a second wave. No second wave has materialized as of October 15, 2020, five months after the epidemic peak.

Countries have adopted non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) to slow down the spread. This study proposes an agent-based model that simulates the spread of COVID-19 among the inhabitants of a city. The agent-based model can be accommodated for any location by integrating parameters specific to the city. The simulation gives the number of total COVID-19 cases. Considering each person as an agent susceptible to COVID-19, the model causes infected individuals to transmit the disease via various actions performed every hour. The model is validated by comparing the simulation to the real data of Ford County, KS, USA. Different interventions, including contact tracing, are applied on a scaled-down version of New York City, USA, and the parameters that lead to a controlled epidemic are determined. Our experiments suggest that contact tracing via smartphones with more than 60% of the population owning a smartphone combined with city-wide lockdown results in the effective reproduction number (R t ) to fall below 1 within 3 weeks of intervention. For 75% or more smartphone users, new infections are eliminated, and the spread is contained within 3 months of intervention. Contact tracing accompanied with early lockdown can suppress the epidemic growth of COVID-19 completely with sufficient smartphone owners. In places where it is difficult to ensure a high percentage of smartphone ownership, tracing only emergency service providers during a lockdown can go a long way to contain the spread.

We have previously shown a presence of a possible relationship between different variables including the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, average age, gender, and malaria treatment, and the rate of spread, severity and mortality of COVID-19 disease. This paper focuses on developing machine learning models for this relationship. METHODS: We have used real-datasets collected from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to develop a model from China data as the baseline country. From this model, we predicted and forecasted different countries' daily confirmed-cases and daily death-cases and examined if there was any possible effect of the variables mentioned above. RESULTS: The model was trained based on China data as a baseline model for daily confirmed-cases and daily death-cases. This machine learning application succeeded in modelling and forecasting daily confirmed-cases and daily death-cases. The modelling and forecasting of viral spread resulted in four different regions; these regions were dependent on the malarial treatments, BCG vaccination, weather conditions, and average age. However, the lack of social distancing resulted in variation in the effect of these factors, for example, double-humped spread and mortality cases curves and sudden increases in the spread and mortality cases in different countries. The process of machine learning for time-series prediction and forecasting, especially in the pandemic COVID-19 domain, proved usefulness in modelling and forecasting the end status of the virus spreading based on specific regional and health support variables. CONCLUSION: From the experimental results, we confirm that COVID-19 has a very low spread in the African countries with all the four variables (average young age, hot weather, BCG vaccine and malaria treatment); a very high spread in European countries and the USA with no variable (old people, cold weather, no BCG vaccine and no malaria). The effect of the variables could be on the spread or the severity to the extent that the infected subject might not have symptoms or the case is mild and can be missed as a confirmed-case. Social distancing decreases the effect of these factors.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33635863,Estimating the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 with imperfect serological tests: Exploiting cutoff-free approaches.,,"Large-scale serological testing in the population is essential to determine the true extent of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and use predefined cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives and use this as a proxy for past infection. With the imperfect assays that are currently available to test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of the cumulative incidence and is usually corrected to account for the sensitivity and specificity. Here we use an inference method-referred to as mixture-model approach-for the estimation of the cumulative incidence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure. We confirm that the mixture model outperforms the methods based on cutoffs, leading to less bias and error in estimates of the cumulative incidence. We illustrate how the mixture model can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests. We also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the test's ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the cumulative incidence. Lastly, we show how this approach can be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of classes of infections with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures. This is a very promising application of the mixture-model approach that could identify the elusive fraction of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. An R-package implementing the inference methods used in this paper is provided. Our study advocates using serological tests without cutoffs, especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals. This approach circumvents some of the shortcomings of cutoff-based methods at exactly the low cumulative incidence levels and test accuracies that we are currently facing in SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys.",Diagnosis;Epidemic Forecasting
33634045,"Systems dynamics approach for modelling South Africa's response to COVID-19: A ""what if"" scenario.",covid-19;seir;systems dynamics,"Background: Many countries in the world are still struggling to control COVID-19 pandemic. As of April 28, 2020, South Africa reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Sub- Sahara Africa. The country took aggressive steps to control the spread of the virus including setting a national command team for COVID-19 and putting the country on a complete lockdown for more than 100 days. Evidence across most countries has shown that, it is vital to monitor the progression of pandemics and assess the effects of various public health measures, such as lockdowns. Countries need to have scientific tools to assist in monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of mitigation interventions. The objective of this study was thus to assess the extent to which a systems dynamics model can forecast COVID-19 infections in South Africa and be a useful tool in evaluating government interventions to manage the epidemic through 'what if' simulations. Design and Methods: This study presents a systems dynamics model (SD) of the COVID-19 infection in South Africa, as one of such tools. The development of the SD model in this study is grounded in design science research which fundamentally builds on prior research of modelling complex systems. Results: The SD model satisfactorily replicates the general trend of COVID-19 infections and recovery for South Africa within the first 100 days of the pandemic. The model further confirms that the decision to lockdown the country was a right one, otherwise the country's health capacity would have been overwhelmed. Going forward, the model predicts that the level of infection in the country will peak towards the last quarter of 2020, and thereafter start to decline. Conclusions: Ultimately, the model structure and simulations suggest that a systems dynamics model can be a useful tool in monitoring, predicting and testing interventions to manage COVID-19 with an acceptable margin of error. Moreover, the model can be developed further to include more variables as more facts on the COVID-19 emerge.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33633275,Inefficiency of SIR models in forecasting COVID-19 epidemic: a case study of Isfahan.,,"The multifaceted destructions caused by COVID-19 have been compared to that of World War II. What makes the situation even more complicated is the ambiguity about the duration and ultimate spread of the pandemic. It is especially critical for the governments, healthcare systems, and economic sectors to have an estimate of the future of this disaster. By using different mathematical approaches, including the classical susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and its derivatives, many investigators have tried to predict the outbreak of COVID-19. In this study, we simulated the epidemic in Isfahan province of Iran for the period from Feb 14th to April 11th and also forecasted the remaining course with three scenarios that differed in terms of the stringency level of social distancing. Despite the prediction of disease course in short-term intervals, the constructed SIR model was unable to forecast the actual spread and pattern of epidemic in the long term. Remarkably, most of the published SIR models developed to predict COVID-19 for other communities, suffered from the same inconformity. The SIR models are based on assumptions that seem not to be true in the case of the COVID-19 epidemic. Hence, more sophisticated modeling strategies and detailed knowledge of the biomedical and epidemiological aspects of the disease are needed to forecast the pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Mortality attributable to COVID-19 in Denmark increased steeply, and peaked in 2020-W14. As preventive measures and national lockdown were implemented from 2020-W12, the attributable mortality started declining within a few weeks. Mortality attributable to COVID-19 from 2020-W09 to 2020-W20 was estimated to 16.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 12.0 to 20.4) per 100,000 person-years. The 2019/20 influenza season was mild with few deaths attributable to influenza, 3.2 (95% CI: 1.1 to 5.4) per 100,000 person-years.ConclusionAttMOMO estimates mortality attributable to several pathogens simultaneously, providing a fuller picture of mortality by COVID-19 during the pandemic in the context of other seasonal diseases and mortality patterns. Using Danish data, we show that the model accurately estimates mortality attributable to COVID-19 and influenza, respectively. We propose using standardised indicators for pathogen circulation in the population, to make estimates comparable between countries and applicable for timely monitoring.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

This study applies growth models to forecast the demand for Intensive Care Unit admissions in Italy during COVID-19. We show that, with only some mild assumptions on the functional form and using short time-series, the model fits past data well and can accurately forecast demand fourteen days ahead (the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the cumulative fourteen days forecasts is 7.64). The model is then applied to derive regional-level forecasts by adopting hierarchical methods that ensure the consistency between national and regional level forecasts. Predictions are compared with current hospital capacity in the different Italian regions, with the aim to evaluate the adequacy of the expansion in the number of beds implemented during the COVID-19 crisis.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33628235,Mid-Epidemic Forecasts of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths: A Bivariate Model Applied to the UK.,,"Background: The evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic has been accompanied by efforts to provide comparable international data on new cases and deaths. There is also accumulating evidence on the epidemiological parameters underlying COVID-19. Hence, there is potential for epidemic models providing mid-term forecasts of the epidemic trajectory using such information. The effectiveness of lockdown or lockdown relaxation can also be assessed by modelling later epidemic stages, possibly using a multiphase epidemic model. Methods: Commonly applied methods to analyse epidemic trajectories or make forecasts include phenomenological growth models (e.g., the Richards family of densities) and variants of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartment model. Here, we focus on a practical forecasting approach, applied to interim UK COVID data, using a bivariate Reynolds model (for cases and deaths), with implementation based on Bayesian inference. We show the utility of informative priors in developing and estimating the model and compare error densities (Poisson-gamma, Poisson-lognormal, and Poisson-log-Student) for overdispersed data on new cases and deaths. We use cross validation to assess medium-term forecasts. We also consider the longer-term postlockdown epidemic profile to assess epidemic containment, using a two-phase model. Results: Fit to interim mid-epidemic data show better fit to training data and better cross-validation performance for a Poisson-log-Student model. Estimation of longer-term epidemic data after lockdown relaxation, characterised by protracted slow downturn and then upturn in cases, casts doubt on effective containment. Conclusions: Many applications of phenomenological models have been to complete epidemics. However, evaluation of such models based simply on their fit to observed data may give only a partial picture, and cross validation against actual trends is also valuable. Similarly, it may be preferable to model incidence rather than cumulative data, although this raises questions about suitable error densities for modelling often erratic fluctuations. Hence, there may be utility in evaluating alternative error assumptions.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

From this standpoint, the scientific researchers have to find good mathematical models that do describe the transmission of such virus and contribute to reducing it in one way or another, where the study of COVID-19 transmission dynamics by mathematical models is very important for analyzing and controlling this disease propagation. Thus, in the current work, we present a new fractional-order mathematical model that describes the dynamics of COVID-19. In the proposed model, the total population is divided into eight classes, in addition to three compartments used to estimate the parameters and initial values. The effective reproduction number ( R 0 ) is derived by next generation matrix (NGM) method and all possible equilibrium points and their stability are investigated in details. We used the reported data (from January 23, 2020, to November 21, 2020) from the National Health Commission (NHC) of China to estimate the parameters and initial conditions (ICs) which suggested for our model. Simulation outcomes demonstrate that the fractional order model (FOM) represents behaviors that follow the real data more accurately than the integer-order model.

33623621,Estimating actual COVID-19 case numbers using cumulative death count-A method of measuring effectiveness of lockdown of non-essential activities: a South African case study.,sars cov-2;case estimate;infection fatality rate;testing coverage,"Introduction: Estimating the number of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals at any specific time point is always a challenge due to asymptomatic cases, the incubation period and testing delays. Here we use an empirical analysis of cumulative death count, transmission-to-death time lag, and infection fatality rate (IFR) to evaluate and estimate the actual cases at a specific time point as a strategy of tracking the spread of COVID-19. Methods: This method mainly uses death count, as COVID-19 related deaths are arguably more reliably reported than infection case numbers. Using an IFR estimate of 0.66%, we back-calculate the number of cases that would result in the cumulative number of deaths at a given time point in South Africa between 27 February and 14 April. We added the mean incubation period (6.4 days) and the onset-to-death time lag (17.8 days) to identify the estimated time lag between transmission and death (25 days, rounded up). We use the statistical programming language R to analyze the data and produce plots. Results: We estimate 28,182 cases as of 14 April, compared with 3,465 reported cases. Weekly growth rate of actual cases dropped immediately after lockdown implementation and has remained steady, measuring at 51.2% as of 14 April. The timing of drop in growth rate suggests that South Africa's infection prevention strategy may have been effective at reducing viral transmission. Conclusion: Estimating the actual number of cases at a specific time point can support evidence-based policies to reduce and prevent the spread of COVID-19. Non-reported, asymptomatic, hard to reach and, mild cases are possible sources of outbreaks that could emerge after lockdown. Therefore, close monitoring, optimized screening strategy and prompt response to COVID-19 could help in stopping the spread of the virus.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Methods: The number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases, recovered cases, and during the period 20 February 2020-21 April 2020 in 21 countries in EMR were extracted from the WHO situation reports. The Curve Estimation procedure was used to produce different curve estimation regression models for the observed data in each country. Results: During this observed period, the total number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths in the region were 138673, 71343, and 6291, respectively. The overall fatality rate in the region was 4.5%. The quadratic model and the cubic model follows the observed data points fairly well during the observed time period in five and nine countries, respectively. The exponential model (Y = b0 * (e**(b1 * t))), the growth model (Y = e**(b0 + (b1 * t))), and the compound model (Y = b0 * (b1**t)) were the best fit for data during the observed time period in two, three, and two countries, respectively.

Therefore studying the prediction of this virus spreading in further attracts a major public attention. In the Arab Emirates (UAE), up to the same date, there are 14,730 positive cases and 137 deaths according to national authorities.

We simulate the available total cases reported based on Riesz wavelets generated by some refinable functions, namely the smoothed pseudosplines of types I and II with high vanishing moments. Based on these data, we also consider the formulation of the pandemic model using the Caputo fractional derivative. Then we numerically solve the nonlinear system that describes the dynamics of COVID-19 with given resources based on the collocation Riesz wavelet system constructed. We present graphical illustrations of the numerical solutions with parameters of the model handled under different situations.

In the past, epidemics have been monitored by various statistical and model metrics, such as evaluation of the effective reproduction number, R ( t ) . However, R ( t ) can be difficult and time consuming to compute. This paper suggests two relatively simple data-based metrics that could be used in conjunction with R ( t ) estimation and provide rapid indicators of how the epidemic's dynamic behavior is progressing. The new metrics are the epidemic rate of change (RC) and a related state-dependent response rate parameter (RP), recursive estimates of which are obtained from dynamic harmonic and dynamic linear regression (DHR and DLR) algorithms. Their effectiveness is illustrated by the analysis of COVID-19 data in the UK and Italy. The paper also shows how similar methodology, combined with the refined instrumental variable method for estimating hybrid Box-Jenkins models of linear dynamic systems (RIVC), can be used to relate the daily death numbers in the Italian and UK epidemics and then provide 15-day-ahead forecasts of the UK daily death numbers. The same approach can be used to model and forecast the UK epidemic based on the daily number of COVID-19 patients in UK hospitals. Finally, the paper speculates on how the state-dependent parameter (SDP) modeling procedures may provide data-based insight into a nonlinear differential equation model for epidemics such as COVID-19.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

COVID-19 forecasts have received much media attention, and numerous platforms have been created to inform the public. However, forecasting effectiveness varies by geographic scope and is affected by changing assumptions in behaviors and preventative measures in response to the pandemic. Due to time requirements for developing a COVID-19 vaccine, evidence is needed to inform short-term forecasting method selection at county, health district, and state levels. OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 forecasts keep the public informed and contribute to public policy. As such, proper understanding of forecasting purposes and outcomes is needed to advance knowledge of health statistics for policy makers and the public. Using publicly available real-time data provided online, we aimed to evaluate the performance of seven forecasting methods utilized to forecast cumulative COVID-19 case counts. Forecasts were evaluated based on how well they forecast 1, 3, and 7 days forward when utilizing 1-, 3-, 7-, or all prior-day cumulative case counts during early virus onset. This study provides an objective evaluation of the forecasting methods to identify forecasting model assumptions that contribute to lower error in forecasting COVID-19 cumulative case growth. This information benefits professionals, decision makers, and the public relying on the data provided by short-term case count estimates at varied geographic levels. METHODS: We created 1-, 3-, and 7-day forecasts at the county, health district, and state levels using (1) a naive approach, (2) Holt-Winters (HW) exponential smoothing, (3) a growth rate approach, (4) a moving average (MA) approach, (5) an autoregressive (AR) approach, (6) an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) approach, and (7) an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) approach. Forecasts relied on Virginia's 3464 historical county-level cumulative case counts from March 7 to April 22, 2020, as reported by The New York Times. Statistically significant results were identified using 95% CIs of median absolute error (MdAE) and median absolute percentage error (MdAPE) metrics of the resulting 216,698 forecasts. RESULTS: The next-day MA forecast with 3-day look-back length obtained the lowest MdAE (median 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.84, P<.001) and statistically significantly differed from 39 out of 59 alternatives (66%) to 53 out of 59 alternatives (90%) at each geographic level at a significance level of .01. For short-range forecasting, methods assuming stationary means of prior days' counts outperformed methods with assumptions of weak stationarity or nonstationarity means. MdAPE results revealed statistically significant differences across geographic levels. CONCLUSIONS: For short-range COVID-19 cumulative case count forecasting at the county, health district, and state levels during early onset, the following were found: (1) the MA method was effective for forecasting 1-, 3-, and 7-day cumulative case counts; (2) exponential growth was not the best representation of case growth during early virus onset when the public was aware of the virus; and (3) geographic resolution was a factor in the selection of forecasting methods.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We employ an epidemic model SIPHERD in which three categories of infection carriers, symptomatic, purely asymptomatic, and exposed are considered with different transmission rates that are taken dependent on the social distancing conditions, and the detection rate of the infected carriers is taken dependent on the tests done per day. The model is first validated for Germany and South Korea and then applied for prediction of the total number of confirmed, active and dead, and daily new positive cases in the United States. Our study predicts the possible outcomes of the infection if social distancing conditions are relaxed or kept stringent. We estimate that around 30.1 million people are already infected, and in the absence of any vaccine, 66.2 million (range: 64.3-68.0) people, or 20% (range: 19.4-20.5) of the population will be infected by mid-February 21 if social distancing conditions are not made stringent.

The epidemic has largely been controlled in China since March 2020, but continues to inflict severe public health and socioeconomic burden in other parts of the world. One of the major reasons for China's success for the fight against the epidemic is the effectiveness of its health care system and enlightenment (awareness) programs which play a vital role in the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nigeria is currently witnessing a rapid increase of the epidemic likely due to its unsatisfactory health care system and inadequate awareness programs. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Our model incorporates awareness programs and different hospitalization strategies for mild and severe cases, to assess the effect of public awareness on the dynamics of COVID-19 infection. We fit the model to the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria from 29 March to 12 June 2020. We find that the epidemic could increase if awareness programs are not properly adopted. We presumed that the effect of awareness programs could be estimated. Further, our results suggest that the awareness programs and timely hospitalization of active cases are essential tools for effective control and mitigation of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria and beyond.

These simulations can provide detailed insight into how molecules behave under certain environmental conditions. This work explores a machine learning (ML) solution to predicting long-term properties of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (S-protein) through the analysis of its nanosecond backbone RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) MD simulation data at varying temperatures. The simulation data were denoised with fast Fourier transforms. The performance of the models was measured by evaluating their mean squared error (MSE) accuracy scores in recurrent forecasts for long-term predictions. The models evaluated include k-nearest neighbors (kNN) regression models, as well as GRU (gated recurrent unit) neural networks and LSTM (long short-term memory) autoencoder models. Results demonstrated that the kNN model achieved the greatest accuracy in forecasts with MSE scores over around 0.01 nm less than those of the GRU model and the LSTM autoencoder. Furthermore, it demonstrated that the kNN model accuracy increases with data size but can still forecast relatively well when trained on small amounts of data, having achieved MSE scores of around 0.02 nm when trained on 10,000 ns of simulation data.

Many different models have been proposed so far correlating different factors. Some of them are too localized to indicate a general trend of the pandemic while some others have established transient correlations only. Hence, in this study, taking Bangladesh as a case, a 4P model has been proposed based on four probabilities (4P) which have been found to be true for all affected countries. Efficiency scores have been estimated from survey analysis not only for governing authorities on managing the situation (P(G)) but also for the compliance of the citizens ((P(P)). Since immune responses to a specific pathogen can vary from person to person, the probability of a person getting infected ((P(I)) after being exposed has also been estimated. And the vital one is the probability of test positivity ((P(T)) which is a strong indicator of how effectively the infected people are diagnosed and isolated from the rest of the group that affects the rate of growth. All the four parameters have been fitted in a non-linear exponential model that partly updates itself periodically with everyday facts.

A biological implication from this study is that a COVID-19 patient with less than one basic reproduction ratio can automatically recover from the infection.",Epidemic Forecasting

As a result, there has been a collective effort to monitor, predict, and control the spread of this disease. Among this effort is the development of mathematical models that could capture accurately the available data and simulate closely the futuristic scenarios. In this paper, a fractional-order memory-dependent model for simulating the spread of COVID-19 is proposed. In this model, the impact of governmental interventions and public perception are incorporated as part of the nonlinear time-varying transmission rate. In addition, an algorithm for approximating the optimal values of the fractional order and strength of governmental interventions is provided. This approach makes our model suitable for capturing the given data set and consequently reliable for future predictions. The model simulation is performed using the two-step generalized exponential time-differencing method and tested for data from Mainland China, Italy, Saudi Arabia and Brazil. The simulation results demonstrate that the fractional order model calibrates to the data better than its integer order counterpart. This observation is further endorsed by the calculated error metrics.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We present a simple epidemiological model that is amenable to implementation in Excel spreadsheets and sufficiently accurate to reproduce observed data on the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemics in different regions [i.e., New York City (NYC), South Korea, Mexico City]. We show that the model can be adapted to closely follow the evolution of COVID-19 in any large city by simply adjusting parameters related to demographic conditions and aggressiveness of the response from a society/government to epidemics. Moreover, we show that this simple epidemiological simulator can be used to assess the efficacy of the response of a government/society to an outbreak. The simplicity and accuracy of this model will greatly contribute to democratizing the availability of knowledge in societies regarding the extent of an epidemic event and the efficacy of a governmental response.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

METHODS: The tool was based on a Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemiological model in which the population is divided into three compartments and transmission parameters are specified to define the rate at which people move between stages. Appropriate data entry was guaranteed by the creation of structured guided paths. The drugs needed for the forecasted patients were estimated according to a list of critical care drugs compiled by consulting previous published scientific works, national and international guidelines. For each drug, an estimation was made of the percentage average ICU uptake for each therapeutic group and active principle. RESULTS: The tool consists of a Microsoft Excel template that is based on the initial epidemiological situation, the non-pharmaceutical interventions applied, the risk of hospitalisation based on the population age distribution, and the hospital beds available. The tool provides a forecast of which patients with COVID-19 will need to be treated in a hospital setting. The number of patients is used to estimate the drugs needed based on the average daily dose and the treatment length of each drug. The possibility of editing the type of distribution (exponential or linear) of the number of patients at the beginning of the analysis, the percentage adherence with non-pharmaceutical interventions and their delayed effect, and all the key epidemiological parameters make the estimation tailorable to different clinical contexts and needs. CONCLUSIONS: This model might be an effective supporting tool that could be easily implemented within the workflow of health professionals. All the information reported in this paper could be useful in developing new strategies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Treatment
33617534,Estimation of the case fatality rate based on stratification for the COVID-19 outbreak.,,"This work is motivated by the recent worldwide pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). When an epidemiological disease is prevalent, estimating the case fatality rate, the proportion of deaths out of the total cases, accurately and quickly is important as the case fatality rate is one of the crucial indicators of the risk of a disease. In this work, we propose an alternative estimator of the case fatality rate that provides more accurate estimate during an outbreak by reducing the downward bias (underestimation) of the naive CFR, the proportion of deaths out of confirmed cases at each time point, which is the most commonly used estimator due to the simplicity. The proposed estimator is designed to achieve the availability of real-time update by using the commonly reported quantities, the numbers of confirmed, cured, deceased cases, in the computation. To enhance the accuracy, the proposed estimator adapts a stratification, which allows the estimator to use information from heterogeneous strata separately. By the COVID-19 cases of China, South Korea and the United States, we numerically show the proposed stratification-based estimator plays a role of providing an early warning about the severity of a epidemiological disease that estimates the final case fatality rate accurately and shows faster convergence to the final case fatality rate.",Epidemic Forecasting
33617518,COVID-19 in Chile: The usefulness of simple epidemic models in practice.,chile;models;covid,"Objectives: The purpose of this article is to describe and develop the predictive value of three models during the COVID-19 epidemic in Chile, providing knowledge for decision-making in health. Methods: We developed three models during the epidemic: a discrete model to predict the maximum burden on the health system in a short time framea basic SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) model with discrete equations; a stochastic SEIR model with the Monte Carlo method; and a Gompertz-type model for metropolitan city of Santiago. Results: The maximum potential burden model has been useful throughout the monitoring of the epidemic, providing an upper bound for the number of cases, intensive care unit occupancy, and deaths. Deterministic and stochastic SEIR models were very useful in predicting the rise of cases and the peak and onset of case decline; however, they lost utility in the current situation due to the asynchronous recruitment of cases in the regions and the persistence of a strong endemic. The Gompertz model had a better fit in the decline since it best captures the epidemic curves asymmetry in Santiago. Conclusions: The models have shown great utility in monitoring the epidemic in Chile, with different objectives in different epidemic stages. They have complemented empirical indicators such as reported cases, fatality, deaths, and others, making it possible to predict situations of interest and visualization of the short and long-term local behavior of this pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

To support medical experts/doctors with the overpowering challenge of prediction of total cases in India, a machine-learning algorithm was developed. In this research article, the author describes the possibility of predicting the COVID-19 total, active cases, death and cured cases in India up to 25th June 2020 by applying linear regression and support vector machine. It is extremely tricky to manage the occurrence of corona virus since it is expanding exponentially day to day and is difficult to handle with a limited number of doctors and beds to treat the infected individuals with limited time. Hence, it is essential to develop a machine learning based computerized predicting model. The development effort in this article is based on publicly available data that is downloaded from KAGGLE to estimate the spread of the disease within a short period. We have calculated the RMSE, R2, MAE of LR and SVR models and concluded that the RMSE of linear regression is less than the SVR. Therefore, the LR will help doctors to forecast for the next few days.",Epidemic Forecasting

The estimations of the model parameters are based on the outbreaks of COVID-19 and cholera in Yemen from January 1, 2020 to May 30, 2020. Moreover, we present an optimal control model for minimizing both the number of infected people and the cost associated with each control. Four preventive measures are to be taken to control the outbreaks: social distancing, lockdown, the number of tests, and the number of chlorine water tablets (CWTs). Under the current conditions and resources available in Yemen, various policies are simulated to evaluate the optimal policy. The results obtained confirm that the policy of providing resources for the distribution of CWTs, providing sufficient resources for testing with an average social distancing, and quarantining of infected individuals has significant effects on flattening the epidemic curves.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Although the recovery rate is greater than the death rate, the COVID-19 infection is becoming very harmful for the human community and causing financial loses to their economy. No proper vaccine for this infection has been introduced in the market in order to treat the infected people. Various approaches have been implemented recently to study the dynamics of this novel infection. Mathematical models are one of the effective tools in this regard to understand the transmission patterns of COVID-19. In the present paper, we formulate a fractional epidemic model in the Caputo sense with the consideration of quarantine, isolation, and environmental impacts to examine the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak. The fractional models are quite useful for understanding better the disease epidemics as well as capture the memory and nonlocality effects. First, we construct the model in ordinary differential equations and further consider the Caputo operator to formulate its fractional derivative. We present some of the necessary mathematical analysis for the fractional model. Furthermore, the model is fitted to the reported cases in Pakistan, one of the epicenters of COVID-19 in Asia. The estimated value of the important threshold parameter of the model, known as the basic reproduction number, is evaluated theoretically and numerically. Based on the real fitted parameters, we obtained R 0 approximately 1.50 . Finally, an efficient numerical scheme of Adams-Moulton type is used in order to simulate the fractional model. The impact of some of the key model parameters on the disease dynamics and its elimination are shown graphically for various values of noninteger order of the Caputo derivative. We conclude that the use of fractional epidemic model provides a better understanding and biologically more insights about the disease dynamics.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The SIR model is constructed by considering the factors of vaccination, treatment, obedience in implementing health protocols, and the corona virus-load. Parameters of the infection rate, recovery rate, and death rate due to COVID-19 are constructed as a fuzzy number, and their membership functions are used in the model as fuzzy parameters. The model analysis uses the generation matrix method to obtain the basic reproduction number and the stability of the model's equilibrium points. Simulation results show that differences in corona virus-loads will also cause differences in the transmission of COVID-19. Likewise, the factors of vaccination and obedience in implementing health protocols have the same effect in slowing or stopping the transmission of COVID-19 in Indonesia.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Initially, the state-space representation for the bats-hosts-reservoir-people (BHRP) model is obtained using a set of fractional order differential equations for the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model. Afterward, the EKF and Kronecker product based WT methods have been applied to the discrete vector representation of the BHRP model. The main advantage of using EKF in this system is that it considers both the process and the measurement noise, which gives better accuracy and probable states, which are the Markovian (processes). The importance of proposed models lies in the fact that these models can accommodate conventional EKF and WT methods as their special cases. Further, we have compared the estimated number of contagious people and recovered people with the actual number of infectious people and recovered people in India and China.",Epidemic Forecasting;Transmission

In this paper, an extension of the well-known susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) family of compartmental model has been introduced with seasonality transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The stability analysis of the coronavirus depends on changing of its basic reproductive ratio. The progress rate of the virus in critical infected cases and the recovery rate have major roles to control this epidemic. Selecting the appropriate critical parameter from the Turing domain, the stability properties of existing patterns is obtained. The outcomes of theoretical studies, which are illustrated via Hopf bifurcation and Turing instabilities, yield the result of numerical simulations around the critical parameter to forecast on controlling this fatal disease. Globally existing solutions of the model has been studied by introducing Tikhonov regularization. The impact of social distancing, lockdown of the country, self-isolation, home quarantine and the wariness of global public health system have significant influence on the parameters of the model system that can alter the effect of recovery rates, mortality rates and active contaminated cases with the progression of time in the real world.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

We expect that the second wave of pandemic will pass its peak at the end of December 2020 for various countries. Moreover, the second wave of pandemic will have come to end at first decade of January 2021 in Germany and Iran (but at the end of January 2021 in India as well), so we should restrict ourselves in modelling the first and second waves of pandemic within this time period for these countries.

The model relies on the specification of various parameters that characterize the virus and the population being modeled. However, several of these parameters can be expected to vary significantly between states. Therefore, a genetic algorithm was developed that adjusts these population-dependent parameters to fit the SEIR model to data for any given state. Methods: Publicly available data was collected from each state in terms of the number of positive COVID-19 cases and the number of COVID-19-caused deaths and used as inputs into a SEIR model to predict the spread of COVID infections in a given population. A genetic algorithm was designed where the genes are the state-dependent parameters from the model. The algorithm operates by determining the fitness of a given set of genes, applying selection, using selected agents to reproduce with cross-over, applying random mutation, and simulating several generations. Findings and Conclusions: Use of the genetic algorithm produces exceptionally good agreement between the model and available data. Deviations in the parameters were examined to see if the trends were reasonable.",Epidemic Forecasting

This study aims to investigate the daily TC and the percentage of positive cases over the tested population (PPCTP) to evaluate the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) trajectory phase and generate benchmarks on desirable TC. Data were retrieved from government facilities, including 101 countries and 55 areas in the USA. We have divided the pandemic situations of investigated areas into four phases, i.e., low-level, suppressing, widespread, or uncertain transmission phase. Findings indicate each country should increase TC to roughly two tests per thousand people each day. Additionally, based on TC, a susceptible-unconfirmed-confirmed-recovered (SUCR) model, which can capture the dynamic growth of confirmed cases and estimate the group size of unconfirmed cases in a country or area, is proposed. We examined our proposed SUCR model for 55 areas in the USA. Results show that the SUCR model can accurately capture the dynamic growth of confirmed cases in each area. By increasing TC by five times and applying strict control measures, the total number of COVID-19 patients would reduce to 33%.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In order to contain infection of this highly contagious disease, most of the world population is constrained to live in a complete or partial lockdown for months together with a minimal human-to-human interaction having far reaching consequences on countries' economy and mental well-being of their citizens. Hence, there is a need for a good predictive model for the health advisory bodies and decision makers for taking calculated proactive measures to contain the pandemic and maintain a healthy economy. This paper extends the mathematical theory of the classical Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model and proposes a Generalized SIR (GSIR) model that is an integrative model encompassing multiple waves of daily reported cases. Existing growth function models of epidemic have been shown as the special cases of the GSIR model. Dynamic modeling of the parameters reflect the impact of policy decisions, social awareness, and the availability of medication during the pandemic. GSIR framework can be utilized to find a good fit or predictive model for any pandemic. The study is performed on the COVID-19 data for various countries with detailed results for India, Brazil, United States of America (USA), and World. The peak infection, total expected number of COVID-19 cases and thereof deaths, time-varying reproduction number, and various other parameters are estimated from the available data using the proposed methodology.

The outbreaks depend on different social and demographic factors based on human mobility structured with the help of mathematical models for vector-borne disease transmission. In Dec 2019, an infectious disease is known as ""coronavirus"" (officially declared as COVID-19 by WHO) emerged in Wuhan (Capital city of Hubei, China) and spread quickly to all over the china with over 50,000 cases including more than 1000 death within a short period of one month. Multimodal modeling of robust dynamics system is a complex, challenging and fast growing area of the research. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this proposed hybrid computing technique are as follows: The innovative design of the NAR-RBFs neural network paradigm is designed to construct the SITR epidemic differential equation (DE) model to ascertain the different features of the spread of COVID-19. The new set of transformations is introduced for nonlinear input to achieve with a higher level of accuracy, stability, and convergence analysis. METHODS: Multimodal modeling of robust dynamics system is a complex, challenging and fast growing area of the research. In this research bimodal spread of COVID-19 is investigated with hybrid model based on nonlinear autoregressive with radial base function (NAR-RBFs) neural network for SITR model. Chaotic and stochastic data of the pandemic. A new class of transformation is presented for the system of ordinary differential equation (ODE) for fast convergence and improvement of desired accuracy level. The proposed transformations convert local optimum values to global values before implementation of bimodal paradigm. RESULTS: This suggested NAR-RBFs model is investigated for the bi-module nature of SITR model with additional feature of fragility in modeling of stochastic variation ability for different cases and scenarios with constraints variation. Best agreement of the proposed bimodal paradigm with outstanding numerical solver is confirmed based on statistical results calculated from MSE, RMSE and MAPE with accuracy level based on mean square error up to 1E-25, which further validates the stability and consistence of bimodal proposed model.

33606684,Epidemiological model for the inhomogeneous spatial spreading of COVID-19 and other diseases.,,"We suggest a novel mathematical framework for the in-homogeneous spatial spreading of an infectious disease in human population, with particular attention to COVID-19. Common epidemiological models, e.g., the well-known susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, implicitly assume uniform (random) encounters between the infectious and susceptible sub-populations, resulting in homogeneous spatial distributions. However, in human population, especially under different levels of mobility restrictions, this assumption is likely to fail. Splitting the geographic region under study into areal nodes, and assuming infection kinetics within nodes and between nearest-neighbor nodes, we arrive into a continuous, ""reaction-diffusion"", spatial model. To account for COVID-19, the model includes five different sub-populations, in which the infectious sub-population is split into pre-symptomatic and symptomatic. Our model accounts for the spreading evolution of infectious population domains from initial epicenters, leading to different regimes of sub-exponential (e.g., power-law) growth. Importantly, we also account for the variable geographic density of the population, that can strongly enhance or suppress infection spreading. For instance, we show how weakly infected regions surrounding a densely populated area can cause rapid migration of the infection towards the populated area. Predicted infection ""heat-maps"" show remarkable similarity to publicly available heat-maps, e.g., from South Carolina. We further demonstrate how localized lockdown/quarantine conditions can slow down the spreading of disease from epicenters. Application of our model in different countries can provide a useful predictive tool for the authorities, in particular, for planning strong lockdown measures in localized areas-such as those underway in a few countries.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33606666,A Bayesian Mixture Model for Predicting the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States.,,"An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global pandemic affecting virtually every country. As of August 31, 2020, globally, there have been approximately 25,500,000 confirmed cases and 850,000 deaths; in the United States (50 states plus District of Columbia), there have been more than 6,000,000 confirmed cases and 183,000 deaths. We propose a Bayesian mixture model to predict and monitor COVID-19 mortality across the United States. The model captures skewed unimodal (prolonged recovery) or multimodal (multiple surges) curves. The results show that across all states, the first peak dates of mortality varied between April 4, 2020 for Alaska and June 18, 2020 for Arkansas. As of August 31, 2020, 31 states had a clear bimodal curve showing a strong second surge. The peak date for a second surge ranged from July 1, 2020 for Virginia to September 12, 2020 for Hawaii. The first peak for the United States occurred about April 16, 2020-dominated by New York and New Jersey-and a second peak on August 6, 2020-dominated by California, Texas, and Florida. Reliable models for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic are essential to informing resource allocation and intervention strategies. A Bayesian mixture model was able to more accurately predict the shape of the mortality curves across the United States than other models, including the timing of multiple peaks. However, given the dynamic nature of the pandemic, it is important that the results be updated regularly to identify and better monitor future waves, and characterize the epidemiology of the pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Start parameters for the model were obtained from observational data after data-smoothing to reduce between-day variation. Three scenarios, 1) no vaccination, 2) vaccination of 60% of the population over 12 months, 3) vaccination of 60% of the population over 7 months were examined. The effects of changes in talpha (doubling-time for the spread of infection, known to be slower in the summer months) and tbeta (half-life of recovery from infection) on the daily number of infectious persons, the cumulative number of infected persons, and the duration of critical occupancy of intensive-care units were also determined. RESULTS: Vaccination produced a marked and rapid reduction in the number of infectious persons (up to -60%) and the total number of infected persons (up to -70%). A 7-month vaccination strategy was significantly more effective than a 12-month strategy. The summer effect came too late to have an additional effect on the spread of infection. Vaccination was predicted to reduce the duration of critical occupancy of intensive-care facilities by ~ 70%. DISCUSSION: The predictions are based on the assumptions that lockdown conditions are maintained and vaccine availability is not limiting. CONCLUSION: Predictions made using the model show that vaccination with a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine can markedly reduce the spread of the COVID-19 disease and the period of critical occupancy of intensive-care facilities in Germany.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Treatment

By analysing the transmission dynamics during the first wave of COVID-19 in the country, the effectiveness of the various levels of control actions taken to flatten the curve can be better quantified and understood. This in turn can help the relevant authorities to better plan for and control the subsequent waves of the pandemic. To achieve this, a deterministic population model for the pandemic is firstly developed to take into consideration the time-dependent characteristics of the model parameters, especially on the ever-evolving value of the reproduction number, which is one of the critical measures used to describe the transmission dynamics of this pandemic. The reproduction number alongside other key parameters of the model can then be estimated by fitting the model to real-world data using numerical optimisation techniques or by inducing ad-hoc control actions as recorded in the news platforms. In this article, the model is verified using a case study based on the data from the first wave of COVID-19 in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The model is fitted to provide estimates for two settings in simulations; time-invariant and time-varying (with bounded constraints) parameters. Finally, some forecasts are made using four scenarios with time-dependent control measures so as to determine which would reflect on the actual situations better.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Yet, important questions such as how deadly it is or its degree of spread within different countries remain unanswered. In this work, we exploit the 'universal' increase of the mortality rate with age observed in different countries since the beginning of their respective outbreaks, combined with the results of the antibody prevalence tests in the population of Spain, to unveil both unknowns. We test these results with an analogous antibody rate survey in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, showing a good agreement. We also argue that the official number of deaths over 70 years old might be importantly underestimated in most of the countries, and we use the comparison between the official records with the number of deaths mentioning COVID-19 in the death certificates to quantify by how much. Using this information, we estimate the infection fatality ratio (IFR) for the different age segments and the fraction of the population infected in different countries assuming a uniform exposure to the virus in all age segments. We also give estimations for the non-uniform IFR using the sero-epidemiological results of Spain, showing a very similar increase of the fatality ratio with age. Only for Spain, we estimate the probability (if infected) of being identified as a case, being hospitalized or admitted in the intensive care units as function of age. In general, we observe a nearly exponential increase of the fatality ratio with age, which anticipates large differences in total IFR in countries with different demographic distributions, with numbers that range from 1.82% in Italy, to 0.62% in China or even 0.14% in middle Africa.",Epidemic Forecasting
33594301,Modeling and forecasting number of confirmed and death caused COVID-19 in IRAN: A comparison of time series forecasting methods.,arima;bsts;covid-19;forecasting;hybrid model;nnetar;time series,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic conditions are still prevalent in Iran and other countries and the monitoring system is gradually discovering new cases every day. Therefore, it is a cause for concern around the world, and forecasting the number of future patients and death cases, although not entirely accurate, helps the governments and health-policy makers to make the necessary decisions and impose restrictions to reduce prevalence. Methods: In this study, we aimed to find the best model for forecasting the number of confirmed and death cases in Iran. For this purpose, we applied nine models including NNETAR, ARIMA, Hybrid, Holt-Winter, BSTS, TBATS, Prophet, MLP, and ELM network models. The quality of forecasting models is evaluated by three performance metrics, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. The best model is selected by the lowest value of performance metrics. Then, the number of confirmed and the death cases forecasted for the 30 next days. The used data in this study is the absolute number of confirmed, death cases from February 20 to August 15, 2020. Results: Our findings suggested that based on existing data in Iran, the suitable model with the lowest performance metrics for confirmed cases data obtained MLP network and the Holt-Winter model is the suitable model for forecasting death cases in the future. These models forecasted on September 14, 2020, we will have 2484 new confirmed and 114 new death cases of COVID-19. Conclusion: According to the results of this study and the existing data, we concluded that the MLP and Holt-Winter models had the lowest error in forecasting in comparison to other methods. Some models had fitted poorly in the test phase and this is because many other factors that are either not available or have been ignored in this study and can affect the accuracy of forecast results. Based on the trend of data and forecast results, the number of confirmed cases and death cases are almost constant and decreasing, respectively. However, due to disease progression and ignoring the recommendations and protocols of the Ministry of health, there is a possibility of re-emerging this disease more seriously in Iran and this requires more preventive care.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33592845,A dynamic model of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak to analyze the effectiveness of control measures.,,"ABSTRACT: The World Health Organization (WHO) classified the spread of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) as a global pandemic in March. Scholars predict that the pandemic will continue into the coming winter and will become a seasonal epidemic in the following year. Therefore, the identification of effective control measures becomes extremely important. Although many reports have been published since the COVID-19 outbreak, no studies have identified the relative effectiveness of a combination of control measures implemented in Wuhan and other areas in China. To this end, a retrospective analysis by the collection and modeling of an unprecedented number of epidemiology records in China of the early stage of the outbreaks can be valuable.In this study, we developed a new dynamic model to describe the spread of COVID-19 and to quantify the effectiveness of control measures. The transmission rate, daily close contacts, and the average time from onset to isolation were identified as crucial factors in viral spreading. Moreover, the capacity of a local health-care system is identified as a threshold to control an outbreak in its early stage. We took these factors as controlling parameters in our model. The parameters are estimated based on epidemiological reports from national and local Center for Disease Control (CDCs).A retrospective simulation showed the effectiveness of combinations of 4 major control measures implemented in Wuhan: hospital isolation, social distancing, self-protection by wearing masks, and extensive medical testing. Further analysis indicated critical intervention conditions and times required to control an outbreak in the early stage. Our simulations showed that South Korea has kept the spread of COVID-19 at a low level through extensive medical testing. Furthermore, a predictive simulation for Italy indicated that Italy would contain the outbreak in late May under strict social distancing.In our general analysis, no single measure could contain a COVID-19 outbreak once a health-care system is overloaded. Extensive medical testing could keep viral spreading at a low level. Wearing masks functions as favorably as social distancing but with much lower socioeconomic costs.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33592029,The basic reproduction number can be accurately estimated within 14 days after societal lockdown: The early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark.,,"OBJECTIVE: Early identification of the basic reproduction number (BRN) is imperative to political decision making during an epidemic. In this study, we estimated the BRN 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after societal lockdown of Denmark during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. METHOD: We implemented the SEIR dynamical system for disease spread without vital dynamics. The BRN was modulated using a sigmoid function. Model parameters were estimated on number of admitted patients, number of patients in intensive care and cumulative number of deaths using the simulated annealing Monte Carlo algorithm. Results are presented with 95% prediction intervals (PI). RESULTS: We were unable to determine any reliable estimate of the BRN at 7 days following lockdown. The BRN had stabilised at day 14 throughout day 28, with the estimate ranging from 0.95 (95% PI: 0.92-0.98) at day 7 to 0.92 (95% PI: 0.92-0.93) at day 28. We estimated the BRN prior to lockdown to be 3.32 (95% PI: 3.31-3.33). The effect of the lockdown was occurring over a period of a few days centred at March 18th (95% PI: 17th-18th) 2020. CONCLUSION: We believe our model provides a valuable tool for decision makers to reliably estimate the effect of a politically determined lockdown during an epidemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Global research efforts have focused on developing effective vaccines against COVID-19. However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and the basic reproductive number, R0, across geographic areas are still not well quantified. Here, we developed and fit a mathematical model to case and death count data collected from the United States and eight European countries during the early epidemic period before broad control measures were implemented. Results show that the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.18 and 0.29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4 and 3.9 days). We found that for such rapid epidemic growth, high levels of intervention efforts are necessary, no matter the goal is mitigation or containment. We discuss the current estimates of the mean serial interval, and argue that existing evidence suggests that the interval is between 6 and 8 days in the absence of active isolation efforts. Using parameters consistent with this range, we estimated the median R0 value to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7-7.3) in the United States and between 3.6 and 6.1 in the eight European countries. We further analyze how vaccination schedules depend on R0, the duration of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and show that individual-level heterogeneity in vaccine induced immunity can significantly affect vaccination schedules.",Epidemic Forecasting;Treatment

We developed this model when the COVID-19 epidemic was at its early phase. We reasoned that, with our model, the effects of different measures could be assessed for infection control. Unlike the homogeneous models, our model accounts for human population heterogeneity, where subpopulations (e.g., age groups) have different infection risks. The heterogeneous model estimates several characteristics of the epidemic more accurately compared to the homogeneous models. According to our analysis, the total number of infections and their peak number are lower compared to the assessment with the homogeneous models. Furthermore, the early-stage infection increase is little changed when population heterogeneity is considered, whereas the late-stage infection decrease slows. The model predicts that the anti-epidemic measures, like the ones undertaken in China and the rest of the world, decrease the basic reproductive number but do not result in the development of a sufficient collective immunity, which poses a risk of a second wave. More recent developments confirmed our conclusion that the epidemic has a high likelihood to restart after the quarantine measures are lifted.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

This study aims to conduct an in-depth analysis by geographic strata: Wuhan City (hereafter referred to as Wuhan) only, Hubei Province (hereafter referred to as Hubei) excluding Wuhan, and China excluding Hubei. Methods: Daily cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases between December 8, 2019 (the date of symptom onset based on patients' recall during the investigation), and March 1, 2020, from official sources and published studies were analyzed. The second derivative model was used for information extraction. Data analysis was conducted separately for the three strata. Results: A total of 80 026 diagnosed COVID-19 cases were reported during the first 85 days of the epidemic, with 49 315 cases from Wuhan, 17 788 from Hubei excluding Wuhan, and 12 923 from China excluding Hubei. Analytical results indicate that the COVID-19 epidemic consists of an Acceleration, a Deceleration, and a Stabilization Phase in all three geographic strata, plus a Silent Attack Phase for Wuhan only. Given the reported incubation period of 14 days, effects of the massive anti-epidemic actions were revealed by both the Acceleration and Deceleration Phases. The Acceleration Phase signaled the effect of the intervention to detect the infected; the Deceleration Phase signaled the declines in new infections after the infected were detected, treated and quarantined. Conclusion: Findings of the study provide new evidence to better monitor the epidemic, evaluate its response to intervention, and predict the trend long.

Background: Estimating the epidemiological parameters of new public health threat (COVID-19) is essential to support and inform public health decision-making in different communities including Iran. Methods: We established a mathematical model to estimate the epidemiological parameters from 19 Feb to 15 March based on daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Iran. Then, we estimated the effect of early traffic restriction on our estimation. Results: We estimated the R0 at 2.11 (95% CI, 1.87-2.50) and the infected number at 92,260 (95% CI: 59,263 -152,212) by 15 March. Our estimate for the ascertainment rate was about 1.2% (95% CI: 1.1-1.4). The latent period estimation was 4.24 (95% CI: 2.84-6.65). We observed a decline in our estimate after considering the traffic restriction. Conclusion: Our results suggest that health authorities in Iran must take impactful strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak to reach R0<1. Therefore, the establishment of complementary, multilateral, and cost-effective measures for the treatment of symptomatic and early diagnosis and isolation of asymptomatic cases/contacts are strongly recommended because of low ascertainment rate and large number of infected cases.

As of July 25th, there are 16.5 million global cumulative confirmed cases, 9.4 million cumulative recovered cases and 0.65 million deaths. There is a tremendous necessity of supervising and estimating future COVID-19 cases to control the spread and help countries prepare their healthcare systems. In this study, time-series models - Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) are used to forecast the epidemiological trends of the COVID-19 pandemic for top-16 countries where 70%-80% of global cumulative cases are located. Initial combinations of the model parameters were selected using the auto-ARIMA model followed by finding the optimized model parameters based on the best fit between the predictions and test data. Analytical tools Auto-Correlation function (ACF), Partial Auto-Correlation Function (PACF), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were used to assess the reliability of the models. Evaluation metrics Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) were used as criteria for selecting the best model. A case study was presented where the statistical methodology was discussed in detail for model selection and the procedure for forecasting the COVID-19 cases of the USA. Best model parameters of ARIMA and SARIMA for each country are selected manually and the optimized parameters are then used to forecast the COVID-19 cases. Forecasted trends for confirmed and recovered cases showed an exponential rise for countries such as the United States, Brazil, South Africa, Colombia, Bangladesh, India, Mexico and Pakistan. Similarly, trends for cumulative deaths showed an exponential rise for countries Brazil, South Africa, Chile, Colombia, Bangladesh, India, Mexico, Iran, Peru, and Russia. SARIMA model predictions are more realistic than that of the ARIMA model predictions confirming the existence of seasonality in COVID-19 data. The results of this study not only shed light on the future trends of the COVID-19 outbreak in top-16 countries but also guide these countries to prepare their health care policies for the ongoing pandemic.

Here we introduce a simple-yet-powerful ensemble methodology for forecasting the trajectory of dynamic growth processes that are defined by a system of non-linear differential equations with applications to infectious disease spread. METHODS: We propose and assess the performance of two ensemble modeling schemes with different parametric bootstrapping procedures for trajectory forecasting and uncertainty quantification. Specifically, we conduct sequential probabilistic forecasts to evaluate their forecasting performance using simple dynamical growth models with good track records including the Richards model, the generalized-logistic growth model, and the Gompertz model. We first test and verify the functionality of the method using simulated data from phenomenological models and a mechanistic transmission model. Next, the performance of the method is demonstrated using a diversity of epidemic datasets including scenario outbreak data of the Ebola Forecasting Challenge and real-world epidemic data outbreaks of including influenza, plague, Zika, and COVID-19. RESULTS: We found that the ensemble method that randomly selects a model from the set of individual models for each time point of the trajectory of the epidemic frequently outcompeted the individual models as well as an alternative ensemble method based on the weighted combination of the individual models and yields broader and more realistic uncertainty bounds for the trajectory envelope, achieving not only better coverage rate of the 95% prediction interval but also improved mean interval scores across a diversity of epidemic datasets. CONCLUSION: Our new methodology for ensemble forecasting outcompete component models and an alternative ensemble model that differ in how the variance is evaluated for the generation of the prediction intervals of the forecasts.",Epidemic Forecasting

METHODS: We used a stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1 designed specifically for COVID-19. It was populated with parameters for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, shipping characteristics and plausible control measures. RESULTS: When no control interventions were in place, we estimated that an outbreak of COVID-19 in New Zealand would occur after a median time of 23 days (assuming a global average for source country incidence of 2.66 new infections per 1,000 population per week, crews of 20 with a voyage length of 10 days and 1 day of shore leave per crew member both in New Zealand and abroad, and 108 port visits by international merchant ships per week). For this example, the uncertainty around when outbreaks occur is wide (an outbreak occurs with 95% probability between 1 and 124 days). The combination of PCR testing on arrival, self-reporting of symptoms with contact tracing and mask use during shore leave increased this median time to 1.0 year (14 days to 5.4 years, or a 49% probability within a year). Scenario analyses found that onboard infection chains could persist for well over 4 weeks, even with crews of only 5 members. CONCLUSION: This modelling work suggests that the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through shore leave from international shipping crews is likely, even after long voyages. But the risk can be substantially mitigated by control measures such as PCR testing and mask use.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Understanding the distribution of disease at the national level contributes to the formulation of public health policies. There are several studies that investigating the influencing factors on distribution of COVID-19 in China. However, more influencing factors need to be considered to improve our understanding about the current epidemic. Moreover, in the absence of effective medicine or vaccine, the Chinese government introduced a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). However, assessing and predicting the effectiveness of these interventions requires further study. In this paper, we used statistical techniques, correlation analysis and GIS mapping expression method to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and the influencing factors of the COVID-19 in mainland China. The results showed that the spread of outbreaks in China's non-Hubei provinces can be divided into five stages. Stage I is the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak; in stage II the new peak of the epidemic was observed; in stage III the outbreak was contained and new cases decreased; there was a rebound in stage IV, and stage V led to level off. Moreover, the cumulative confirmed cases were mainly concentrated in the southeastern part of China, and the epidemic in the cities with large population flows from Wuhan was more serious. In addition, statistically significant correlations were found between the prevalence of the epidemic and the temperature, rainfall and relative humidity. To evaluate the NPIs, we simulated the prevalence of the COVID-19 based on an improved SIR model and under different prevention intensity. It was found that our simulation results were compatible with the observed values and the parameter of the time function in the improved SIR model for China is a = - 0.0058.

Challenges to modelling include inadequate viral physiology comprehension and fluctuating definitions of positivity between national-to-international data. This paper proposes that accurate forecasting of COVID-19 caseload may be best preformed non-parametrically, by vector autoregression (VAR) of verifiable data regionally. Methods: A non-linear VAR model across 7 major demographically representative New York City (NYC) metropolitan region counties was constructed using verifiable daily COVID-19 caseload data March 12-July 23, 2020. Through association of observed case trends with a series of (county-specific) data-driven dynamic interdependencies (lagged values), a systematically non-assumptive approximation of VAR representation for COVID-19 patterns to-date and prospective upcoming trends was produced. Results: Modified VAR regression of NYC area COVID-19 caseload trends proves highly significant modelling capacity of observed patterns in longitudinal disease incidence (county R(2) range: 0.9221-0.9751, all p < 0.001). Predictively, VAR regression of daily caseload results at a county-wide level demonstrates considerable short-term forecasting fidelity (p < 0.001 at one-step ahead) with concurrent capacity for longer-term (tested 11-week period) inferences of consistent, reasonable upcoming patterns from latest (model data update) disease epidemiology. Conclusions: In contrast to macroscopic variable-assumption projections, regionally-founded VAR modelling may substantially improve projection of short-term community disease burden, reduce potential for biostatistical error, as well as better model epidemiological effects resultant from intervention. Predictive VAR extrapolation of existing public health data at an interdependent regional scale may improve accuracy of current pandemic burden prognoses.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

An accurate estimate of this fraction is crucial for the assessment of the situation and the establishment of protective measures. In most current studies using epidemics models, the total number of infected is either approximated by the number of diagnosed individuals or is dependent on the model parameters and assumptions, which are often debated. We here study the relationship between the fraction of diagnosed infected out of all infected, and the fraction of infected with known contaminator out of all diagnosed infected. We show that those two are approximately the same in exponential models and across most models currently used in the study of epidemics, independently of the model parameters.

The COVID-19 epidemic in Greece was explored through a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis framework, and the optimal values for the parameters that determined the transmission dynamics could be obtained before, during, and after the interventions to control the epidemic. The dynamic change of the fraction of asymptomatic individuals was shown. The analysis of the modelling results at the intra-annual climatic scale allowed for in depth investigation of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the significance and relative importance of the model parameters. Moreover, the analysis at this scale incorporated the exploration of the forecast horizon and its variability. Three discrete peaks were found in the transmission rates throughout the investigated period (15 February-15 December 2020). Two of them corresponded to the timing of the spring and autumn epidemic waves while the third one occurred in mid-summer, implying that relaxation of social distancing and increased mobility may have a strong effect on rekindling the epidemic dynamics offsetting positive effects from factors such as decreased household crowding and increased environmental ultraviolet radiation. In addition, the epidemiological state was found to constitute a significant indicator of the forecast reliability horizon, spanning from as low as few days to more than four weeks. Embedding the model in an ensemble framework may extend the predictability horizon.

Such models only require a small number of parameters to describe epidemic growth patterns. They can be expressed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the type C(')(t)=f(t,C;Theta) for t>0, C(0)=C0, where t is time, C(t) is the total size of the epidemic (the cumulative number of cases) at time t, C0 is the initial number of cases, f is a model-specific incidence function, and Theta is a vector of parameters. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a scenario for which such models are of obvious importance. In Burger et al. (2019) it is demonstrated that some PGMs are better at fitting data of specific epidemic outbreaks than others even when the models have the same number of parameters. This situation motivates the need to measure differences in the dynamics that two different models are capable of generating. The present work contributes to a systematic study of differences between PGMs and how these may explain the ability of certain models to provide a better fit to data than others. To this end a so-called empirical directed distance (EDD) is defined to describe the differences in the dynamics between different dynamic models. The EDD of one PGM from another one quantifies how well the former fits data generated by the latter. The concept of EDD is, however, not symmetric in the usual sense of metric spaces. The procedure of calculating EDDs is applied to synthetic data and real data from influenza, Ebola, and COVID-19 outbreaks.",Epidemic Forecasting

The province-level analysis indicates that the effective reproduction numbers of the majority of provinces in mainland China got down to < 1 just by one week from the setting of control measures, and the temporal reproduction number of the week [15 Feb, 21 Feb] is only about 0.18.

33570080,Challenges in estimating virus divergence times in short epidemic timescales with special reference to the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.,,"The estimation of evolutionary parameters provides essential information for designing public health policies. In short time intervals, however, nucleotide substitutions are ineffective to record all complexities of virus population dynamics. In this sense, the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses a challenge for evolutionary analysis. We used computer simulation to evolve populations in scenarios of varying temporal intervals to evaluate the impact of the age of an epidemic on estimates of time and geography. Before estimating virus timescales, the shape of tree topologies can be used as a proxy to assess the effectiveness of the virus phylogeny in providing accurate estimates of evolutionary parameters. In short timescales, estimates have larger uncertainty. We compared the predictions from simulations with empirical data. The tree shape of SARS-CoV-2 was closer to shorter timescales scenarios, which yielded parametric estimates with larger uncertainty, suggesting that estimates from these datasets should be evaluated cautiously. To increase the accuracy of the estimates of virus transmission times between populations, the uncertainties associated with the age estimates of both the crown and stem nodes should be communicated. We place the age of the common ancestor of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in late September 2019, corroborating an earlier emergence of the virus.",Epidemic Forecasting;Mechanism;Transmission
33568100,Inferencing superspreading potential using zero-truncated negative binomial model: exemplification with COVID-19.,covid-19;contact tracing;heterogeneity in infectiousness;statistical inference;superspreading;transmission,"BACKGROUND: In infectious disease transmission dynamics, the high heterogeneity in individual infectiousness indicates that few index cases generate large numbers of secondary cases, which is commonly known as superspreading events. The heterogeneity in transmission can be measured by describing the distribution of the number of secondary cases as a negative binomial (NB) distribution with dispersion parameter, k. However, such inference framework usually neglects the under-ascertainment of sporadic cases, which are those without known epidemiological link and considered as independent clusters of size one, and this may potentially bias the estimates. METHODS: In this study, we adopt a zero-truncated likelihood-based framework to estimate k. We evaluate the estimation performance by using stochastic simulations, and compare it with the baseline non-truncated version. We exemplify the analytical framework with three contact tracing datasets of COVID-19. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the estimation bias exists when the under-ascertainment of index cases with 0 secondary case occurs, and the zero-truncated inference overcomes this problem and yields a less biased estimator of k. We find that the k of COVID-19 is inferred at 0.32 (95%CI: 0.15, 0.64), which appears slightly smaller than many previous estimates. We provide the simulation codes applying the inference framework in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The zero-truncated framework is recommended for less biased transmission heterogeneity estimates. These findings highlight the importance of individual-specific case management strategies to mitigate COVID-19 pandemic by lowering the transmission risks of potential super-spreaders with priority.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

METHODS: The IHME projections from May to August 2020 for Brazil and selected states were compared with the ensuing reported number of cumulative deaths. RESULTS: The pandemic was projected to cause 182,809 deaths by December 1, 2020 in Brazil. An increase in mask use could reduce the projected death toll by ~17,000. The mean error in the cumulative number of deaths at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the projections were made was 13%, 18% and 22%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Short and medium-term projections provide important and sufficiently accurate data to inform health managers, elected officials, and society at large.

The low health immunity, lifestyle, access to good healthcare services, and social-security cause this population to be at risk of far more direct effects of COVID-19 than the host population. Therefore, evidence-based forecasting of the COVID-19 burden is vital in this regard. In this study, we aimed to forecast the COVID-19 obligation among the Rohingya refugees of Bangladesh to keep up with the disease outbreak's pace, health needs, and disaster preparedness. Methodology and Findings: To estimate the possible consequences of COVID-19 in the Rohingya camps of Bangladesh, we used a modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) transmission model. All of the values of different parameters used in this model were from the Bangladesh Government's database and the relevant emerging literature. We addressed two different scenarios, i.e., the best-fitting model and the good-fitting model with unique consequences of COVID-19. Our best fitting model suggests that there will be reasonable control over the transmission of the COVID-19 disease. At the end of December 2020, there will be only 169 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Rohingya refugee camps. The average basic reproduction number (R0) has been estimated to be 0.7563. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that, due to the extensive precautions from the Bangladesh government and other humanitarian organizations, the coronavirus disease will be under control if the maintenance continues like this.

One of the proposed models is delay-free while the other one considers a delay in the propagation of the infection. The objective is to estimate the transmission, also known as infectivity rate, through time taking into account the infection evolution data supplied by the official health care systems in both countries. Such a parameter is estimated through time at different regional levels and it is seen to be strongly dependent on the intervention measures such as the total (except essential activities) or partial levels of lockdown. Typically, the infectivity rate evolves towards a minimum value under total lockdown and it increases again when the confinement measures are partially or totally removed.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission
33561915,Inherently high uncertainty in predicting the time evolution of epidemics.,covid-19;epidemiology;mathematical model;uncertainty,"OBJECTIVES: Amid the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with its high infectivity, we have relied on mathematical models to predict the temporal evolution of the disease. This paper aims to show that, due to active behavioral changes of individuals and the inherent nature of infectious diseases, it is complicated and challenging to predict the temporal evolution of epidemics. METHODS: A modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-hospitalized-removed (SEIHR) compartment model with a discrete feedback-controlled transmission rate was proposed to incorporate individuals' behavioral changes into the model. To figure out relative uncertainties in the infection peak time and the fraction of the infected population at the peak, a deterministic method and 2 stochastic methods were applied. RESULTS: A relatively small behavioral change of individuals with a feedback constant of 0.02 in the modified SEIHR model resulted in a peak time delay of up to 50% using the deterministic method. Incorporating stochastic methods into the modified model with a feedback constant of 0.04 suggested that the relative random uncertainty of the maximum fraction of infections and that of the peak time for a population of 1 million reached 29% and 9%, respectively. Even without feedback, the relative uncertainty of the peak time increased by up to 20% for a population of 100,000. CONCLUSIONS: It is shown that uncertainty originates from stochastic properties of infections. Without a proper selection of the evolution scenario, active behavioral changes of individuals could serve as an additional source of uncertainty.",Epidemic Forecasting

Thus, the expression of the basic reproduction number using the next generating matrix was derived. We also investigated the local stability of the equilibrium points. Additionally, we examined the existence and uniqueness of the solution for both extensions of these models. Comparisons of these two epidemic modeling approaches (i.e. CF and ABC fractional derivative) illustrated that, for non-integer tau value. The ABC approach had a significant effect on the dynamics of the epidemic and provided new perspective for its utilization as a tool to advance research in disease transmission dynamics for critical COVID-19 cases.

However, all models are based on simplifying assumptions and often on sparse data. This limits the reliability of parameter estimates and predictions. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the relevance of these limitations and the pitfalls associated with the use of overly simplistic models. We considered the data for the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, as an example, and perform parameter estimation, uncertainty analysis and model selection for a range of established epidemiological models. Amongst others, we employ Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, parameter and prediction profile calculation algorithms. Our results show that parameter estimates and predictions obtained for several established models on the basis of reported case numbers can be subject to substantial uncertainty. More importantly, estimates were often unrealistic and the confidence/credibility intervals did not cover plausible values of critical parameters obtained using different approaches. These findings suggest, amongst others, that standard compartmental models can be overly simplistic and that the reported case numbers provide often insufficient information for obtaining reliable and realistic parameter values, and for forecasting the evolution of epidemics.",Epidemic Forecasting
33556142,Estimation of the fraction of COVID-19 infected people in U.S. states and countries worldwide.,,"Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, daily counts of confirmed cases and deaths have been publicly reported in real-time to control the virus spread. However, substantial undocumented infections have obscured the true size of the currently infected population, which is arguably the most critical number for public health policy decisions. We developed a machine learning framework to estimate time courses of actual new COVID-19 cases and current infections in all 50 U.S. states and the 50 most infected countries from reported test results and deaths. Using published epidemiological parameters, our algorithm optimized slowly varying daily ascertainment rates and a time course of currently infected cases each day. Severe under-ascertainment of COVID-19 cases was found to be universal across U.S. states and countries worldwide. In 25 out of the 50 countries, actual cumulative cases were estimated to be 5-20 times greater than the confirmed cases. Our estimates of cumulative incidence were in line with the existing seroprevalence rates in 46 U.S. states. Our framework projected for countries like Belgium, Brazil, and the U.S. that ~10% of the population has been infected once. In the U.S. states like Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida, more than 4% of the population was estimated to be currently infected, as of September 3, 2020, while in New York this fraction is 0.12%. The estimation of the actual fraction of currently infected people is crucial for any definition of public health policies, which up to this point may have been misguided by the reliance on confirmed cases.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Methods: This study was carried out according to three dimensions. In the first, the actual number of infected people was estimated. In the second, the expected total numbers of infected people, deaths, hospitalizations have been predicted in the case of no intervention. In the third, the distribution of the expected number of infected people and deaths, and ICU and non-ICU bed needs over time has been predicted via a SEIR-based simulator (TURKSAS) in four scenarios. Results: According to the number of deaths, the estimated number of infected people in Turkey on March 21 was 123,030. In the case of no intervention the expected number of infected people is 72,091,595 and deaths is 445,956, the attack rate is 88.1%, and the mortality ratio is 0.54%. The ICU bed capacity in Turkey is expected to be exceeded by 4.4-fold and non-ICU bed capacity by 3.21-fold. In the second and third scenarios compliance with NPIs makes a difference of 94,303 expected deaths. In both scenarios, the predicted peak value of occupied ICU and non-ICU beds remains below Turkey's capacity.

Mathematical modeling is a useful tool and gains much interest in this regard. In this paper, a fractional-order transmission model is considered to study its dynamical behavior using the real cases reported in Saudia Arabia. The classical Caputo type derivative of fractional order is used in order to formulate the model. The transmission of the infection through the environment is taken into consideration. The documented data since March 02, 2020 up to July 31, 2020 are considered for estimation of parameters of system. We have the estimated basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for the data is 1.2937 . The Banach fixed point analysis has been used for the existence and uniqueness of the solution. The stability analysis at infection free equilibrium and at the endemic state are presented in details via a nonlinear Lyapunov function in conjunction with LaSalle Invariance Principle. An efficient numerical scheme of Adams-Molten type is implemented for the iterative solution of the model, which plays an important role in determining the impact of control measures and also sensitive parameters that can reduce the infection in the general public and thereby reduce the spread of pandemic as shown graphically.

The proposed model incorporates both asymptomatic infectious and hospitalized infectious subpopulations to the standard infectious subpopulation of the classical SEIR model. In parallel, it also incorporates feedback vaccination and antiviral treatment controls. The exposed subpopulation has three different transitions to the three kinds of infectious subpopulations under eventually different proportionality parameters. The existence of a unique disease-free equilibrium point and a unique endemic one is proved together with the calculation of their explicit components. Their local asymptotic stability properties and the attainability of the endemic equilibrium point are investigated based on the next generation matrix properties, the value of the basic reproduction number, and nonnegativity properties of the solution and its equilibrium states. The reproduction numbers in the presence of one or both controls is linked to the control-free reproduction number to emphasize that such a number decreases with the control gains. We also prove that, depending on the value of the basic reproduction number, only one of them is a global asymptotic attractor and that the solution has no limit cycles.",Epidemic Forecasting

In total, 674,339 confirmed cases and 16,734 mortality cases were reported by 30 September 2020, and this pandemic has made severe impacts on economy and life. In this paper, analysis and long-term prediction of the epidemic dynamics of SA are made, which could assist the government and public in assessing the past Infection Prevention and Control Measures and designing the future ones to contain the epidemic more effectively. A Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model is adopted to analyse epidemic dynamics. The model parameters are estimated over different phases with the SA data. They indicate variations in the transmissibility of COVID-19 under different phases and thus reveal weakness of the past Infection Prevention and Control Measures in SA. The model also shows that transient behaviours of the daily growth rate and the cumulative removal rate exhibit periodic oscillations. Such dynamics indicates that the underlying signals are not stationary and conventional linear and nonlinear models would fail for long-term prediction. Therefore, a large class of mappings with rich functions and operations is chosen as the model class and the evolutionary algorithm is utilized to obtain the optimal model for long term prediction. The resulting models on the daily growth rate, the cumulative removal rate and the cumulative mortality rate predict that the peak and inflection point will occur on November 4, 2020 and October 15, 2020, respectively; the virus shall cease spreading on April 28, 2021; and the ultimate numbers of the COVID-19 cases and mortality cases will be 785,529 and 17,072, respectively.

We take into account the presence of asymptomatic infections and the main policies that have been adopted so far to contain the epidemic: social distancing, isolation of a portion of the population, quarantine for confirmed cases and testing. We refer to quarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases. In the proposed model, the proportion of people in isolation, the level of contact reduction and the testing rate are control parameters that can vary in time, representing policies that evolve in different stages. We obtain an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number R0 in terms of the parameters of the disease and of the control policies. In this way we can quantify the effect that isolation and testing have in the evolution of the epidemic. We present a series of simulations to illustrate different realistic scenarios. From the expression of R0 and the simulations we conclude that isolation (social distancing) and testing among asymptomatic cases are fundamental actions to control the epidemic, and the stricter these measures are and the sooner they are implemented, the more effective they are in flattening the curve of infections. Additionally, we show that people that remain in isolation significantly reduce their probability of contagion, so risk groups should be recommended to maintain a low contact rate during the course of the epidemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

By incorporating the epidemiological and population flow data, we have successfully constructed a multi-regional, hierarchical-tier SLIHR model. With this model, we revealed insight into how COVID-19 was spread from the epicentre Wuhan to other regions in Mainland China based on the large population flow network data.

33533980,[Nationwide exposure model for COVID-19 intensive care unit admission].,acute respiratory distress syndrome;icu;model;scenario;simulation,"BACKGROUND: Forecasting models for intensive care occupancy of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are important in the current pandemic for strategic planning of patient allocation and avoidance of regional overcrowding. They are often trained entirely on retrospective infection and occupancy data, which can cause forecast uncertainty to grow exponentially with the forecast horizon. METHODOLOGY: We propose an alternative modeling approach in which the model is created largely independent of the occupancy data being simulated. The distribution of bed occupancies for patient cohorts is calculated directly from occupancy data from ""sentinel clinics"". By coupling with infection scenarios, the prediction error is constrained by the error of the infection dynamics scenarios. The model allows systematic simulation of arbitrary infection scenarios, calculation of bed occupancy corridors, and sensitivity analyses with respect to protective measures. RESULTS: The model was based on hospital data and by adjusting only two parameters of data in the Aachen city region and Germany as a whole. Using the example of the simulation of the respective bed occupancy rates for Germany as a whole, the loading model for the calculation of occupancy corridors is demonstrated. The occupancy corridors form barriers for bed occupancy in the event that infection rates do not exceed specific thresholds. In addition, lockdown scenarios are simulated based on retrospective events. DISCUSSION: Our model demonstrates that a significant reduction in forecast uncertainty in occupancy forecasts is possible by selectively combining data from different sources. It allows arbitrary combination with infection dynamics models and scenarios, and thus can be used both for load forecasting and for sensitivity analyses for expected novel spreading and lockdown scenarios.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in Sao Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the predictive capacity of this model was limited by the accuracy of the available data, our results showed that social distancing is currently the best non-pharmacological measure.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

To observe the dynamics of the system, a detailed stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) of the proposed model is carried out. Our result shows that the DFE is stable if the basic reproduction number is less than unity and unstable otherwise. Also, the parameters of the assumed model are estimated using the actual data of COVID-19 from Ethiopia reported for three months between March and June 2020. Furthermore, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number and found that reducing the rate of transmission is the most important factor in achieving disease control. Numerical simulations demonstrate the suitability of the proposed model for the actual COVID-19 data in Ethiopia. In particular, the numerical simulation shows an increase in the rate of transmission leads to a significant increase in the infected individuals. Thus, results of the numerical simulations are in agreement with the sensitivity results of the system. The possible implication of this is that declining the rate of transmission to the desired level could enable us to combat the disease. Numerical simulations are also performed to forecast the disease prevalence in the community.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

To gain a deeper understanding about the future dynamics of COVID-19, a compartmental mathematical model has been proposed in this paper incorporating all possible non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies. Model parameters have been calibrated using sophisticated trust-region-reflective algorithm and short-term projection results have been illustrated for Bangladesh and India. Control reproduction numbers ( R c ) have been calculated in order to get insights about the current epidemic scenario in the above-mentioned countries. Forecasting results depict that the aforesaid countries are having downward trends in daily COVID-19 cases. Nevertheless, as the pandemic is not over in any country, it is highly recommended to use efficacious face coverings and maintain strict physical distancing in public gatherings. All necessary graphical simulations have been performed with the help of Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivatives. In addition, optimal control strategies for fractional system have been designed and the existence of unique solution has also been showed using Picard-Lindelof technique. Finally, unconditional stability of the fractional numerical technique has been proved.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33530563,Estimating Unreported COVID-19 Cases with a Time-Varying SIR Regression Model.,covid-19;sir;infection fatality rate;time-varying parameters;unreported infection rate,"BACKGROUND: Potential unreported infection might impair and mislead policymaking for COVID-19, and the contemporary spread of COVID-19 varies in different counties of the United States. It is necessary to estimate the cases that might be underestimated based on county-level data, to take better countermeasures against COVID-19. We suggested taking time-varying Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models with unreported infection rates (UIR) to estimate factual COVID-19 cases in the United States. METHODS: Both the SIR model integrated with unreported infection rates (SIRu) of fixed-time effect and SIRu with time-varying parameters (tvSIRu) were applied to estimate and compare the values of transmission rate (TR), UIR, and infection fatality rate (IFR) based on US county-level COVID-19 data. RESULTS: Based on the US county-level COVID-19 data from 22 January (T1) to 20 August (T212) in 2020, SIRu was first tested and verified by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. Further regression of SIRu at the county-level showed that the average values of TR, UIR, and IFR were 0.034%, 19.5%, and 0.51% respectively. The ranges of TR, UIR, and IFR for all states ranged from 0.007-0.157 (mean = 0.048), 7.31-185.6 (mean = 38.89), and 0.04-2.22% (mean = 0.22%). Among the time-varying TR equations, the power function showed better fitness, which indicated a decline in TR decreasing from 227.58 (T1) to 0.022 (T212). The general equation of tvSIRu showed that both the UIR and IFR were gradually increasing, wherein, the estimated value of UIR was 9.1 (95%CI 5.7-14.0) and IFR was 0.70% (95%CI 0.52-0.95%) at T212. INTERPRETATION: Despite the declining trend in TR and IFR, the UIR of COVID-19 in the United States is still on the rise, which, it was assumed would decrease with sufficient tests or improved countersues. The US medical system might be largely affected by severe cases amidst a rapid spread of COVID-19.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33530012,A framework for surveillance of emerging pathogens at the human-animal interface: Pigs and coronaviruses as a case study.,coronavirus;pig;spillover;surveillance;swine,"Pigs (Sus scrofa) may be important surveillance targets for risk assessment and risk-based control planning against emerging zoonoses. Pigs have high contact rates with humans and other animals, transmit similar pathogens as humans including CoVs, and serve as reservoirs and intermediate hosts for notable human pandemics. Wild and domestic pigs both interface with humans and each other but have unique ecologies that demand different surveillance strategies. Three fundamental questions shape any surveillance program: where, when, and how can surveillance be conducted to optimize the surveillance objective? Using theory of mechanisms of zoonotic spillover and data on risk factors, we propose a framework for determining where surveillance might begin initially to maximize a detection in each host species at their interface. We illustrate the utility of the framework using data from the United States. We then discuss variables to consider in refining when and how to conduct surveillance. Recent advances in accounting for opportunistic sampling designs and in translating serology samples into infection times provide promising directions for extracting spatio-temporal estimates of disease risk from typical surveillance data. Such robust estimates of population-level disease risk allow surveillance plans to be updated in space and time based on new information (adaptive surveillance) thus optimizing allocation of surveillance resources to maximize the quality of risk assessment insight.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

METHODS: Data from Colombian official case information were collated for a period of 5 months. Dynamical parameters of the disease spread were then estimated from the data. Probability distribution models were identified, representing the time from symptom onset to hospitalization, to intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and to death. Kaplan-Meier estimates were also computed for the probability of eventually requiring hospitalization, needing ICU attention, and dying from the disease (the case fatality ratio). RESULTS: Probability distributions of the times and probabilities were computed for the population and for groups based on age and sex. The results showed that for the times that characterize the course of the disease for a given patient (time to hospitalization, ICU admission, or death), the variation from one age group to another was very small (around 10% of the fixed effect intercept) and the effect of sex was even smaller (around 1%). The course of the disease appeared to be very similar for all patients. On the other hand, the probability that a patient would advance from one stage of the disease to another (to hospitalization, ICU admission, or death) was heavily influenced by sex and age. The relative risk of death for male individuals was 1.7 times that of female individuals (based on 22 924 deaths). CONCLUSIONS: The times from one stage of the disease to another were almost independent of the major patient variables (sex, age). This was in stark contrast to the probabilities of progressing from one stage to another, which showed a strong dependence on age and sex. Data also showed that the length of hospital and ICU stays were almost independent of sex and age. The only factor that affected this length was the eventual outcome of the disease (survival or death); the time was significantly longer for surviving patients.",Epidemic Forecasting

As reported by the World Health Organization, the outbreak of COVID-19 has spread across the world, killed many, collapsed economies and changed the way people live since it was first reported in Wuhan, China, in the end of 2019. As at the end of December 2020, it had led to over 2.8 million confirmed cases in Africa with over 67 thousand deaths. The trend poses a huge threat to global public health. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. We employed a SEIHCRD mathematical transmission model with reported Kenyan data on cases of COVID-19 to estimate how transmission varies over time. The model is concise in structure, and successfully captures the course of the COVID-19 outbreak, and thus sheds light on understanding the trends of the outbreak. The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R 0) from the model to assess the factors driving the infection. The model illustrates the effect of mass testing on COVID-19 as well as individual self initiated behavioral change. The results have significant impact on the management of COVID-19 and implementation of prevention policies. The results from the model analysis shows that aggressive and effective mass testing as well as individual self initiated behaviour change play a big role in getting rid of the COVID-19 epidemic otherwise the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The local asymptotic stability of the equilibrium points, the disease-free equilibrium point, the apocalypse equilibrium point and the co-existing equilibrium point are analyzed by the aide of Schur-Cohn criteria. Furthermore and by incorporating the Allee function at time t, we consider the extinction case of the outbreak to analyze the conditions for a strong Allee Effect.

The deterministic model is formulated by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that is built upon the classical SEIR framework. The stochastic model is formulated by a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) that is derived based on the ODE model with constant parameters. The nonlinear CTMC model is approximated by a multitype branching process to obtain an analytical estimate for the probability of a disease outbreak. The local and global dynamics of the disease are analyzed by using the deterministic model with constant parameters, and the result indicates that the basic reproduction number $ \mathcal{R}_0 $ serves as a sharp disease threshold: the disease dies out if $ \mathcal{R}_0\le 1 $ and persists if $ \mathcal{R}_0 > 1 $. In contrast to the deterministic dynamics, the stochastic dynamics indicate that the disease may not persist when $ \mathcal{R}_0 > 1 $. Parameter estimation and validation are performed to fit our ODE model to the public reported data. Our result indicates that both the exposed and infected classes play an important role in shaping the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. In addition, numerical simulations indicate that a second wave of the ongoing pandemic is likely to occur if the prevention and control strategies are not implemented properly.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We calibrate the proposed model to fit the four data sets, viz. data for the states of Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and overall India, and estimate the rate of infection of susceptible with symptomatic population and recovery rate of quarantined individuals. We also estimate basic reproduction number to illustrate the epidemiological status of the regions under study. Our simulations infer that the infective population will be on increasing curve for Maharashtra and India, and settling for Tamil Nadu and Delhi. Sophisticated techniques of sensitivity analysis are employed to determine the impacts of model parameters on basic reproduction number and symptomatic infected individuals. Our results reveal that to curtail the disease burden in India, specific control strategies should be implemented effectively so that the basic reproduction number is decreased below unity. The three control strategies are shown to be important preventive measures to lower disease transmission rate. The model is further extended to its stochastic counterpart to encapsulate the variation or uncertainty observed in the disease transmissibility. We observe the variability in the infective population and found their distribution at certain fixed time, which shows that for small populations, the stochasticity will play an important role.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Because of its strong contagiousness, rapid spread and great harm, it has already given countries around the world serious effects. So far there is no clear specific drug. Scientifically grasping the development law of epidemics is extremely important for preventing and controlling epidemics. Since the latent of this epidemic are also highly contagious, traditional infectious disease models cannot accurately describe the regularity of this epidemic transmission. Based on the traditional infectious disease model, an infectious disease model with a time delay is proposed. The time difference is used to characterize the cycle of viral infection and treatment time. Using the epidemic data released in real time, firstly, through the numerical simulation parameter inversion, the minimum error is obtained; then we simulate the development trend of the epidemic according to the dynamics system; finally, we compare and analyze the effectiveness of isolation measures.

METHODS: We searched for and included published articles, preprint manuscripts and reports that estimated numbers of cumulative or daily deaths or cases of COVID-19 in Iran. We found 131 studies and included 29 of them. RESULTS: The included studies provided outputs for a total of 84 study-model/scenario combinations. Sixteen studies used 3-4 compartmental disease models. At the end of month two of the epidemic (2020-04-19), the lowest (and highest) values of predictions were 1,777 (388,951) for cumulative deaths, 20,588 (2,310,161) for cumulative cases, and at the end of month four (2020-06-20), were 3,590 (1,819,392) for cumulative deaths, and 144,305 (4,266,964) for cumulative cases. Highest estimates of cumulative deaths (and cases) for latest date available in 2020 were 418,834 on 2020-12-19 (and 41,475,792 on 2020-12-31). Model estimates predict an ominous course of epidemic progress in Iran. Increase in percent population using masks from the current situation to 95% might prevent 26,790 additional deaths (95% confidence interval 19,925-35,208) by the end of year 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Meticulousness and degree of details reported for disease modeling and statistical methods used in the included studies varied widely. Greater heterogeneity was observed regarding the results of predicted outcomes. Consideration of minimum and preferred reporting items in epidemic estimation studies might better inform future revisions of the available models and new models to be developed.

COVID-19 was emerged due to the SARS-CoV-2 that is highly infectious pandemic. Every country tried to control the COVID-19 spread by imposing different types of lockdowns. Therefore, there is an urgent need to forecast the daily confirmed infected cases and deaths in different types of lockdown to select the most appropriate lockdown strategies to control the intensity of this pandemic and reduce the burden in hospitals. Currently are imposed three types of lockdown (partial, herd, complete) in different countries. In this study, three countries from every type of lockdown were studied by applying time-series and machine learning models, named as random forests, K-nearest neighbors, SVM, decision trees (DTs), polynomial regression, Holt winter, ARIMA, and SARIMA to forecast daily confirm infected cases and deaths due to COVID-19. The models' accuracy and effectiveness were evaluated by error based on three performance criteria. Actually, a single forecasting model could not capture all data sets' trends due to the varying nature of data sets and lockdown types. Three top-ranked models were used to predict the confirmed infected cases and deaths, the outperformed models were also adopted for the out-of-sample prediction and obtained very close results to the actual values of cumulative infected cases and deaths due to COVID-19. This study has proposed the auspicious models for forecasting and the best lockdown strategy to mitigate the causalities of COVID-19.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Revealing the characteristics and epidemic trends are important parts of disease control. The biological scenarios including transmission characteristics can be constructed and translated into mathematical models, which can help to predict and gain a deeper understanding of diseases. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the models for infectious diseases and highlights their values in the field of public health. This information will be of interest to mathematicians and clinicians, and make a significant contribution toward the development of more specific and effective models. Literature searches were performed using the online database of PubMed (inception to August 2020). EXPERT OPINION: Modeling could contribute to infectious disease control by means of predicting the scales of disease epidemics, indicating the characteristics of disease transmission, evaluating the effectiveness of interventions or policies, and warning or forecasting during the pre-outbreak of diseases.

The disease has become pandemic, affecting almost all nations of the world, and has caused enormous economic, social and psychological burden on countries. Hygiene and educational campaign programmes have been identified to be potent public health interventions that can curtail the spread of the highly infectious disease. In order to verify this claim quantitatively, we propose and analyze a non-linear mathematical model to investigate the effect of healthy sanitation and awareness on the transmission dynamics of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) prevalence. Rigorous stability analysis of the model equilibrium points was performed to ascertain the basic reproduction number R 0, a threshold that determines whether or not a disease dies out of the population. Our model assumes that education on the disease transmission and prevention induce behavioral changes in individuals to imbibe good hygiene, thereby reducing the basic reproduction number and disease burden.

However, majority of the earlier contributions have used classical time series models, such as auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, to obtain the said forecasts for Iran and its neighbors. In addition, the impacts of lifting the lockdowns in the said countries have not been studied. The aim of this paper is to propose more flexible Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models for forecasting the future trends of the COVID-19 in Iran and its neighbors, and to compare the predictive power of the BSTS models with frequently used ARIMA models. The paper also aims to investigate the casual impacts of lifting the lockdown in the targeted countries using proposed models. Methods: We have proposed BSTS models to forecast the patterns of this pandemic in Iran and its neighbors. The predictive power of the proposed models has been compared with ARIMA models using different forecast accuracy criteria. We have also studied the causal impacts of resuming commercial/social activities in these countries using intervention analysis under BSTS models. The forecasts for next thirty days were obtained by using the data from March 16 to July 22, 2020. These data have been obtained from Our World in Data and Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX). All the numerical results have been obtained using R software. Results: Different measures of forecast accuracy advocated that forecasts under BSTS models were better than those under ARIMA models. Our forecasts suggested that the active numbers of cases are expected to decrease in Iran and its neighbors, except Afghanistan. However, the death toll is expected to increase at more pace in majority of these countries. The resuming of commercial/social activities in these countries has accelerated the surges in number of positive cases. Conclusions: The serious efforts would be needed to make sure that these expected figures regarding active number of cases come true. Iran and its neighbors need to improve their extensive healthcare infrastructure to cut down the higher expected death toll. Finally, these countries should develop and implement the strict SOPs for the commercial activities in order to prevent the expected second wave of the pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We are studying here a potential bias induced by the daily number of tests which may be insufficient or vary over time. Indeed, tests are hard to produce at the early stage of the epidemic and can therefore be a limiting factor in the detection of cases. Such a limitation may have a strong impact on the reported cases data. Indeed, some cases may be missing from the official count because the number of tests was not sufficient on a given day. In this work, we propose a new differential equation epidemic model which uses the daily number of tests as an input. We obtain a good agreement between the model simulations and the reported cases data coming from the state of New York. We also explore the relationship between the dynamic of the number of tests and the dynamics of the cases. We obtain a good match between the data and the outcome of the model.

A forecast procedure combining a log-polynomial model together with a first-order integer-valued autoregressive model is proposed. An out-of-sample comparison with forecasts from an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is considered. This comparison indicates that our procedure outperforms the ARIMA model. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the ARIMA is always greater than that of the our procedure and generally more than twice as high as the our procedure RMSE. We have also conducted Diebold and Mariano (1995) tests of equal mean square error (MSE). The tests results confirm that forecasts from our procedure are significantly more accurate at all horizons. We think that the advantage of our approach comes from the fact that it explicitly takes into account the number of swabs.",Epidemic Forecasting

Although there Although there is currently a a a vaccine, preventive measures have been proposed to reduce the spread of infection but the efficacy of these interventions, and their likely impact on the number of COVID-19 infections is unknown. In this study, we proposed the SEIQHRS model (susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-hospitalized-recovered-susceptible) model that predicts the trajectory of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy for COVID-19 in Ghana. We provided a short-term forecast of the early phase of the epidemic trajectory in Ghana using the generalized growth model. We estimated the effective basic Reproductive number Re in real-time using three different estimation procedures and simulated worse case epidemic scenarios and the impact of integrated individual and government interventions on the epidemic in the long term using compartmental models. The maximum likelihood estimates of Re and the corresponding 95% confidence interval was 2.04 [95% CI: 1.82-2.27; 12th March-7th April 2020]. The Re estimate using the exponential growth method was 2.11 [95% CI: 2.00-2.24] within the same period. The Re estimate using time-dependent (TD) method showed a gradual decline of the Effective Reproductive Number since March 12, 2020 when the first 2 index cases were recorded but the rate of transmission remains high (TD: Re = 2.52; 95% CI: [1.87-3.49]). The current estimate of Re based on the TD method is 1.74 [95% CI: 1.41-2.10; (13th May 2020)] but with comprehensive integrated government and individual level interventions, the Re could reduce to 0.5 which is an indication of the epidemic dying out in the general population.

As a result, COVID-19 has caused a major threat to global public health. In this paper, we use mathematical modeling to analyze the reported data of COVID-19 cases in Vietnam and study the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions. To achieve this, two models are used to describe the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. The first model belongs to the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) type and is used to compute the basic reproduction number. The second model adopts a multi-scale approach which explicitly integrates the movement of each individual. Numerical simulations are conducted to quantify the effects of social distancing measures on the spread of COVID-19 in urban areas of Vietnam. Both models show that the adoption of relaxed social distancing measures reduces the number of infected cases but does not shorten the duration of the epidemic waves. Whereas, more strict measures would lead to the containment of each epidemic wave in one and a half months.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Due to the lack of information about the behaviour of the virus, several prediction models are in use all over around the world for decision making and taking precautionary actions. Therefor, in this paper, a new model named MSIR based on SIR model is proposed. The model is used to predict the spread of the disease in three cities Riyadh, Hufof and Jeddah in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Also the estimation of disease propagation with and without containment measure is carried out. We think that the results could be used to enhance the predictability of the pandemic outbreaks in other cities and to build long term artificial intelligence prediction model.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Some specific statistical attributes of the GLET-GTII are investigated, such as quantiles, uncertainty measures, survival function, moments, reliability, and hazard function etc. We describe two methods of parametric estimations of GLET-GTII discussed by using maximum likelihood estimators and Bayesian paradigm. The Monte Carlo simulation analysis shows that estimators are consistent. Two real life implementations are performed to scrutinize the suitability of our current strategy.

This infection caused million of infected cases globally and still pose an alarming situation for human lives. Pakistan in Asian countries is considered the third country with higher number of cases of coronavirus with more than 200,000. Recently, many mathematical models have been considered to better understand the coronavirus infection. Most of these models are based on classical integer-order derivative which can not capture the fading memory and crossover behavior found in many biological phenomena. Therefore, we study the coronavirus disease in this paper by exploring the dynamics of COVID-19 infection using the non-integer Caputo derivative. In the absence of vaccine or therapy, the role of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is examined on the dynamics of theCOVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan. First, we construct the model in integer sense and then apply the fractional operator to have a generalized model. The generalized model is then used to present the detailed theoretical results. We investigate the stability of the model for the case of fractional model using a nonlinear fractional Lyapunov function of Goh-Voltera type. Furthermore, we estimate the values of parameters with the help of least square curve fitting tool for the COVID-19 data recorded in Pakistan since March 1 till June 30, 2020 and show that our considered model give an accurate prediction to the real COVID-19 statistical cases.

After the recent COVID-19 outbreak, almost all countries were forced to impose strict measures and regulations in order to control the virus spread. Predicting the number of new cases is crucial when evaluating which measures should be implemented. The improved forecasting approach was then used to predict the number of the COVID-19 cases. The proposed prediction model represents a hybridized approach between machine learning, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and enhanced beetle antennae search swarm intelligence metaheuristics. The enhanced beetle antennae search is utilized to determine the parameters of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and to improve the overall performance of the prediction model. First, an enhanced beetle antennae search algorithm has been implemented that overcomes deficiencies of its original version. The enhanced algorithm was tested and validated against a wider set of benchmark functions and proved that it substantially outperforms original implementation. Afterwards, the proposed hybrid method for COVID-19 cases prediction was then evaluated using the World Health Organization's official data on the COVID-19 outbreak in China. The proposed method has been compared against several existing state-of-the-art approaches that were tested on the same datasets. The proposed CESBAS-ANFIS achieved R 2 score of 0.9763, which is relatively high when compared to the R 2 value of 0.9645, achieved by FPASSA-ANFIS. To further evaluate the robustness of the proposed method, it has also been validated against two different datasets of weekly influenza confirmed cases in China and the USA.

The current virus disease COVID-19 outbreak raises an unparalleled public health issue for the world at large. Wuhan is the city in China from where this virus came first and, after some time the whole world was affected by this severe disease. It is a challenge for every country's people and higher authorities to fight with this battle due to the insufficient number of resources. On-going assessment of the epidemiological features and future impacts of the COVID-19 disease is required to stay up-to-date of any changes to its spread dynamics and foresee needed resources and consequences in different aspects as social or economic ones. This paper proposes a prediction model of confirmed and death cases of COVID-19. The model is based on a deep learning algorithm with two long short-term memory (LSTM) layers. We consider the available infection cases of COVID-19 in India from January 22, 2020, till October 9, 2020, and parameterize the model.

We developed an ordinary differential equation-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovery (SEIR) model with Bayesian underpinning to estimate the main parameter of R0 determined by transmission coefficients, incubation period, and the recovery rate. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation method was used to tackle the parameters of uncertainty resulting from the outbreak of COVID-19 given a small cohort of the cruise ship. The extended stratified SEIR model was also proposed to elucidate the heterogeneity of transmission route by the level of deck with passengers and crews. With the application of the overall model, R0 was estimated as high as 5.70 (95% credible interval: 4.23-7.79). The entire epidemic period without containment measurements was approximately 47 days and reached the peak one month later after the index case. The partial containment measure reduced 63% (95% credible interval: 60-66%) infected passengers. With the deck-specific SEIR model, the heterogeneity of R0 estimates by each deck was noted. The estimated R0 figures were 5.18 for passengers (5-14 deck), mainly from the within-deck transmission, and 2.46 for crews (2-4 deck), mainly from the between-deck transmission. Modelling the dynamic of COVID-19 on the cruise ship not only provides an insight into timely evacuation and early isolation and quarantine but also elucidates the relative contributions of different transmission modes on the cruise ship though the deck-stratified SEIR model.

Hence, we incorporate numerous memory indexes in the proposed model, i.e., distinct fractional-orders defined by a time-dependent function that permits us to set specific memory contributions during the evolution. This allows controlling the memory effects of more early states, e.g., before and after a quarantine decree, which could be less relevant than the contribution of more recent ones on the current state of the SIRD system.

This paper constructs a time delay reaction-diffusion model that is closer to the actual spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, including relapse, time delay, home quarantine and temporal-spatial heterogeneous environment that affect the spread of COVID-19. These factors increase the number of equations and the coupling between equations in the system, making it difficult to apply the methods commonly used to discuss global dynamics, such as the Lyapunov function method. Therefore, we use the global exponential attractor theory in the infinite-dimensional dynamic system to study the spreading trend of the COVID-9 epidemic with relapse, time delay, home quarantine in a temporal-spatial heterogeneous environment. Using our latest results of global exponential attractor theory, the global asymptotic stability and the persistence of the COVID-19 epidemic are discussed. We find that due to the influence of relapse in the in temporal-spatial heterogeneity environment, the principal eigenvalue lambda * can describe the spread of the epidemic more accurately than the usual basic reproduction number R 0 . That is, the non-constant disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when lambda * < 0 and the COVID-19 epidemic is persisting uniformly when lambda * > 0 . Combine with the latest official data of the COVID-19 and the prevention and control strategies of different countries, some numerical simulations on the stability and global exponential attractiveness of the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in China and the USA are given. The simulation results fully reflect the impact of the temporal-spatial heterogeneous environment, relapse, time delay and home quarantine strategies on the spread of the epidemic, revealing the significant differences in epidemic prevention strategies and control effects between the East and the West.

We provide the basic properties of the model and compute the basic reproduction number R 0 that plays an important role in the outcome of the disease. After, assuming continuous measurement of newly COVID-19 reported cases, deceased and recovered individuals, the EnKf approach is used to estimate the unmeasured variables and unknown COVID-19 transmission rates using real data of the current COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon. We present the forecasts of the current pandemic in Cameroon and explore the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as mass media-based sensitization, social distancing, face-mask wearing, contact tracing and the desinfection and decontamination of infected places by using suitable products against free coronaviruses in the environment in order to reduce the spread of the disease. Through numerical simulations, we find that at that time (i) R 0 approximately 2.9495 meaning that the disease will not die out without any control measures, (ii) the infection from COVID-19 infected cases is more important than the infection from free coronaviruses in the environment, (iii) the number of new COVID-19 cases will still increase and there is a necessity to increase timely the surveillance by using contact tracing and sensibilisation of the population to respect social distancing, face-masks wearing through awareness programs and (iv) the eradication of the pandemic is highly dependent on the control measures taken by governments.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In this manuscript, we study the epidemic prophecy for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV) epidemic in Wuhan, China by using q-homotopy analysis transform method (q-HATM). We considered the reported case data to parameterise the model and to identify the number of unreported cases. A new analysis with the proposed epidemic 2019-nCOV model for unreported cases is effectuated. For the considered system exemplifying the model of coronavirus, the series solution is established within the frame of the Caputo derivative. The developed results are explained using figures which show the behaviour of the projected model. The results show that the used scheme is highly emphatic and easy to implementation for the system of nonlinear equations. Further, the present study can confirm the applicability and effect of fractional operators to real-world problems.",Epidemic Forecasting

The high prevalence of mild cases facilitates sub-notification outside hospital environments and the number of those who are or have been infected remains largely unknown, leading to poor estimates of the crude mortality rate of the disease. Here we use a simple model to describe the number of accumulated deaths caused by COVID-19. The close connection between the proposed model and an approximate solution of the SIR model provides estimates of epidemiological parameters. We find values for the crude mortality between 10 - 4 and 10 - 3 which are lower than estimated numbers obtained from laboratory-confirmed patients. We also calculate quantities of practical interest such as the basic reproduction number and subsequent increment after relaxation of lockdown and other control measures.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We use our model to predict when the peak of the epidemic will arise in terms of new cases or new deaths in each country and the peak level.

The functional form for infections incorporates important features of epidemiological models but is flexibly parameterized to capture different trajectories of the pandemic. Daily deaths are modeled as a spike-and-slab regression on lagged cases. Our Bayesian estimation reveals that social distancing and testing have significant effects on the parameters.

Recent studies suggest that the population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, a proxy for the number of asymptomatic cases, could be an order of magnitude larger than expected from the number of reported symptomatic cases. Knowing the precise prevalence and contagiousness of asymptomatic transmission is critical to estimate the overall dimension and pandemic potential of COVID-19. However, at this stage, the effect of the asymptomatic population, its size, and its outbreak dynamics remain largely unknown. Here we use reported symptomatic case data in conjunction with antibody seroprevalence studies, a mathematical epidemiology model, and a Bayesian framework to infer the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Our model computes, in real time, the time-varying contact rate of the outbreak, and projects the temporal evolution and credible intervals of the effective reproduction number and the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recovered populations. Our study quantifies the sensitivity of the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 to three parameters: the effective reproduction number, the ratio between the symptomatic and asymptomatic populations, and the infectious periods of both groups. For nine distinct locations, our model estimates the fraction of the population that has been infected and recovered by Jun 15, 2020 to 24.15% (95% CI: 20.48%-28.14%) for Heinsberg (NRW, Germany), 2.40% (95% CI: 2.09%-2.76%) for Ada County (ID, USA), 46.19% (95% CI: 45.81%-46.60%) for New York City (NY, USA), 11.26% (95% CI: 7.21%-16.03%) for Santa Clara County (CA, USA), 3.09% (95% CI: 2.27%-4.03%) for Denmark, 12.35% (95% CI: 10.03%-15.18%) for Geneva Canton (Switzerland), 5.24% (95% CI: 4.84%-5.70%) for the Netherlands, 1.53% (95% CI: 0.76%-2.62%) for Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), and 5.32% (95% CI: 4.77%-5.93%) for Belgium. Our method traces the initial outbreak date in Santa Clara County back to January 20, 2020 (95% CI: December 29, 2019-February 13, 2020). Our results could significantly change our understanding and management of the COVID-19 pandemic: A large asymptomatic population will make isolation, containment, and tracing of individual cases challenging. Instead, managing community transmission through increasing population awareness, promoting physical distancing, and encouraging behavioral changes could become more relevant.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission
33518800,Modelling COVID-19 transmission in the United States through interstate and foreign travels and evaluating impact of governmental public health interventions.,covid-19;public health;transmission;travel,"Background: The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission
33514781,Transmission dynamics and control measures of COVID-19 outbreak in China: a modelling study.,,"COVID-19 is reported to have been brought under control in China. To understand the COVID-19 outbreak in China and provide potential lessons for other parts of the world, in this study we apply a mathematical model with multiple datasets to estimate the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the severity of the illness associated with the infection, and how both were affected by unprecedented control measures. Our analyses show that before 19th January 2020, 3.5% (95% CI 1.7-8.3%) of infected people were detected; this percentage increased to 36.6% (95% CI 26.1-55.4%) thereafter. The basic reproduction number (R0) was 2.33 (95% CI 1.96-3.69) before 8th February 2020; then the effective reproduction number dropped to 0.04(95% CI 0.01-0.10). This estimation also indicates that control measures taken since 23rd January 2020 affected the transmissibility about 2 weeks after they were introduced. The confirmed case fatality rate is estimated at 9.6% (95% CI 8.1-11.4%) before 15 February 2020, and then it reduced to 0.7% (95% CI 0.4-1.0%). This shows that SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly transmissible but may be less severe than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. We found that at the early stage, the majority of R0 comes from undetected infectious people. This implies that successful control in China was achieved through reducing the contact rates among people in the general population and increasing the rate of detection and quarantine of the infectious cases.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission
33513139,Assessing the potential impact of transmission during prolonged viral shedding on the effect of lockdown relaxation on COVID-19.,,"A key parameter in epidemiological modeling which characterizes the spread of an infectious disease is the generation time, or more generally the distribution of infectiousness as a function of time since infection. There is increasing evidence supporting a prolonged viral shedding window for COVID-19, but the transmissibility in this phase is unclear. Based on this, we develop a generalized Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model including an additional compartment of chronically infected individuals who can stay infectious for a longer duration than the reported generation time, but with infectivity reduced to varying degrees. Using the incidence and fatality data from different countries, we first show that such an assumption also yields a plausible model in explaining the data observed prior to the easing of the lockdown measures (relaxation). We then test the predictive power of this model for different durations and levels of prolonged infectiousness using the incidence data after the introduction of relaxation in Switzerland, and compare it with a model without the chronically infected population to represent the models conventionally used. We show that in case of a gradual easing on the lockdown measures, the predictions of the model including the chronically infected population vary considerably from those obtained under a model in which prolonged infectiousness is not taken into account. Although the existence of a chronically infected population still remains largely hypothetical, we believe that our results provide tentative evidence to consider a chronically infected population as an alternative modeling approach to better interpret the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission
33513137,Estimating the time-varying reproduction number of COVID-19 with a state-space method.,,"After slowing down the spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, many countries have started to relax their confinement measures in the face of critical damage to socioeconomic structures. At this stage, it is desirable to monitor the degree to which political measures or social affairs have exerted influence on the spread of disease. Though it is difficult to trace back individual transmission of infections whose incubation periods are long and highly variable, estimating the average spreading rate is possible if a proper mathematical model can be devised to analyze daily event-occurrences. To render an accurate assessment, we have devised a state-space method for fitting a discrete-time variant of the Hawkes process to a given dataset of daily confirmed cases. The proposed method detects changes occurring in each country and assesses the impact of social events in terms of the temporally varying reproduction number, which corresponds to the average number of cases directly caused by a single infected case. Moreover, the proposed method can be used to predict the possible consequences of alternative political measures. This information can serve as a reference for behavioral guidelines that should be adopted according to the varying risk of infection.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

As of June 10, 2020, in Philadelphia, the observed citywide period prevalence was 1.5%. After accounting for bias in the surveillance data, the median posterior citywide true prevalence was 2.3% when accounting for ADI and 2.1% when not. Overall the median posterior surveillance sensitivity and specificity from the models were similar, about 60% and more than 99%, respectively.

33507962,Modeling the relative risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to inform risk-cost-benefit analyses of activities during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.,,"Risk-cost-benefit analysis requires the enumeration of decision alternatives, their associated outcomes, and the quantification of uncertainty. Public and private decision-making surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic must contend with uncertainty about the probability of infection during activities involving groups of people, in order to decide whether that activity is worth undertaking. We propose a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection probability that can produce estimates of relative risk of infection for diverse activities, so long as those activities meet a list of assumptions, including that they do not last longer than one day (e.g., sporting events, flights, concerts), and that the probability of infection among possible routes of infection (i.e., droplet, aerosol, fomite, and direct contact) are independent. We show how the model can be used to inform decisions facing governments and industry, such as opening stadiums or flying on airplanes; in particular, it allows for estimating the ranking of the constituent components of activities (e.g., going through a turnstile, sitting in one's seat) by their relative risk of infection, even when the probability of infection is unknown or uncertain. We prove that the model is a good approximation of a more refined model in which we assume infections come from a series of independent risks. A linearity assumption governing several potentially modifiable risks factors-such as duration of the activity, density of participants, and infectiousness of the attendees-makes interpreting and using the model straightforward, and we argue that it does so without significantly diminishing the reliability of the model.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We introduce a novel variational-LSTM Autoencoder model to predict the spread of coronavirus for each country across the globe. This deep Spatio-temporal model does not only rely on historical data of the virus spread but also includes factors related to urban characteristics represented in locational and demographic data (such as population density, urban population, and fertility rate), an index that represents the governmental measures and response amid toward mitigating the outbreak (includes 13 measures such as: 1) school closing, 2) workplace closing, 3) cancelling public events, 4) close public transport, 5) public information campaigns, 6) restrictions on internal movements, 7) international travel controls, 8) fiscal measures, 9) monetary measures, 10) emergency investment in health care, 11) investment in vaccines, 12) virus testing framework, and 13) contact tracing). In addition, the introduced method learns to generate a graph to adjust the spatial dependences among different countries while forecasting the spread. We trained two models for short and long-term forecasts. The first one is trained to output one step in future with three previous timestamps of all features across the globe, whereas the second model is trained to output 10 steps in future. Overall, the trained models show high validation for forecasting the spread for each country for short and long-term forecasts, which makes the introduce method a useful tool to assist decision and policymaking for the different corners of the globe.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

During 2009, H1N1 Influenza pandemic, statistical and mathematical methods were used to track how the virus spreads around countries. Most of these models that were developed at the beginning of the XXI century are based on the classical susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model developed almost a hundred years ago. The evolution of this model allows us to forecast and compute basic and effective reproduction numbers (R t and R 0 ), measures that quantify the epidemic potential of a pathogen and estimates different scenarios. In this study, we present a traditional estimation technique for R 0 with statistical distributions by best fitting and a Bayesian approach based on continuous feed of prior distributions to obtain posterior distributions and computing real time R t . We use data from COVID-19 officially reported cases in Ecuador since the first confirmed case on February 29th. Because of the lack of data, in the case of R 0 we compare two methods for the estimation of these parameters below exponential growth and maximum likelihood estimation. We do not make any assumption about the evolution of cases due to limited information and we use previous methods to compare scenarios about R 0 and in the case of R t we used Bayesian inference to model uncertainty in contagious proposing a new modification to the well-known model of Bettencourt and Ribeiro based on a time window of m days to improve estimations. Ecuadorian R 0 with exponential growth criteria was 3.45 and with the maximum likelihood estimation method was 2.93. The results show that Guayas, Pichincha and Manabi were the provinces with the highest number of cases due to COVID-19. Some reasons explain the increased transmissibility in these localities: massive events, population density, cities dispersion patterns, and the delayed time of public health actions to contain pandemic. In conclusion, this is a novel approach that allow us to measure infection dynamics and outbreak distribution when not enough detailed data is available. The use of this model can be used to predict pandemic distribution and to implement data-based effective measures.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

As in many countries, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany has led to a consecutive roll-out of different NPIs. As these NPIs have (largely unknown) adverse effects, targeting them precisely and monitoring their effectiveness are essential. We developed a compartmental infection dynamics model with specific features of SARS-CoV-2 that allows daily estimation of a time-varying reproduction number and published this information openly since the beginning of April 2020. Here, we present the transmission dynamics in Germany over time to understand the effect of NPIs and allow adaptive forecasts of the epidemic progression. METHODS: We used a data-driven estimation of the evolution of the reproduction number for viral spreading in Germany as well as in all its federal states using our model. Using parameter estimates from literature and, alternatively, with parameters derived from a fit to the initial phase of COVID-19 spread in different regions of Italy, the model was optimized to fit data from the Robert Koch Institute. RESULTS: The time-varying reproduction number (Rt) in Germany decreased to <1 in early April 2020, 2-3 weeks after the implementation of NPIs. Partial release of NPIs both nationally and on federal state level correlated with moderate increases in Rt until August 2020. Implications of state-specific Rt on other states and on national level are characterized. Retrospective evaluation of the model shows excellent agreement with the data and usage of inpatient facilities well within the healthcare limit. While short-term predictions may work for a few weeks, long-term projections are complicated by unpredictable structural changes. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated fraction of immunized population by August 2020 warns of a renewed outbreak upon release of measures. A low detection rate prolongs the delay reaching a low case incidence number upon release, showing the importance of an effective testing-quarantine strategy. We show that real-time monitoring of transmission dynamics is important to evaluate the extent of the outbreak, short-term projections for the burden on the healthcare system, and their response to policy changes.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Also, we have taken into account the susceptible population, which by taking preventive measures viz., by having strong immunity, maintaining social distancing, wearing PPE kits and masks etc., is able to reduce the possibility of getting infected from the virus. Local as well as global stability of the equilibrium points of the model have been studied using Lyapunov function and the geometrical approach techniques. Basic reproduction number has also been obtained by using the next generation matrix.

Thus far, there have been some implementations of artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied to develop epidemiology curve for a specific country. However, most applied AI methods generated models that are almost impossible to translate into a mathematical equation. In this paper, the AI method called genetic programming (GP) algorithm is utilized to develop a symbolic expression (mathematical equation) which can be used for the estimation of the epidemiology curve for the entire U.S. with high accuracy. The GP algorithm is utilized on the publicly available dataset that contains the number of confirmed, deceased and recovered patients for each U.S. state to obtain the symbolic expression for the estimation of the number of the aforementioned patient groups. The dataset consists of the latitude and longitude of the central location for each state and the number of patients in each of the goal groups for each day in the period of 22nd January 2020-3rd December 2020. The obtained symbolic expressions for each state are summed up to obtain symbolic expressions for estimation of each of the patient groups (confirmed, deceased and recovered). These symbolic expressions are combined to obtain the symbolic expression for the estimation of the epidemiology curve for the entire U.S. The obtained symbolic expressions for the estimation of the number of confirmed, deceased and recovered patients for each state achieved R2 score in the ranges 0.9406-0.9992, 0.9404-0.9998 and 0.9797-0.99955, respectively. These equations are summed up to formulate symbolic expressions for the estimation of the number of confirmed, deceased and recovered patients for the entire U.S. with achieved R2 score of 0.9992, 0.9997 and 0.9996, respectively. Using these symbolic expressions, the equation for the estimation of the epidemiology curve for the entire U.S. is formulated which achieved R2 score of 0.9933.

This study aimed to assess and predict the incidence of COVID-19 in Thailand, including the preparation and evaluation of intervention strategies. An SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered) model was implemented with model parameters estimated using the Bayesian approach. The model's projections showed that the highest daily reported incidence of COVID-19 would be approximately 140 cases (95% credible interval, CrI: 83-170 cases) by the end of March 2020. After Thailand declared an emergency decree, the numbers of new cases and case fatalities decreased, with no new imported cases. According to the model's predictions, the incidence would be zero at the end of June if non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were strictly and widely implemented. These stringent NPIs reduced the effective reproductive number (Rt) to 0.73 per day (95% CrI: 0.53-0.93) during April and May. Sensitivity analysis showed that contact rate, hand washing, and face mask wearing effectiveness were the parameters that most influenced the number of reported daily new cases. Our evaluation shows that Thailand's intervention strategies have been highly effective in mitigating disease propagation.

We presented numerous statistical analyses of collected data from both continents using numerous existing statistical theories. Our predictions show the possibility of the second wave of spread in Europe in the worse scenario and an exponential growth in the number of infections in Africa. The projection of statistical analysis leads us to introducing an extended version of the well-blancmange function to further capture the spread with fractal properties. A mathematical model depicting the spread with nine sub-classes is considered, first converted to a stochastic system, where the existence and uniqueness are presented. Then the model is extended to the concept of nonlocal operators; due to nonlinearity, a modified numerical scheme is suggested and used to present numerical simulations. The suggested mathematical model is able to predict two to three waves of the spread in the near future.",Epidemic Forecasting

The survey reveals that plenty of epidemiological models outcast the simple population dynamics solution. Most of the future predictions based on these epidemiological models are highly unreliable because of the complexity of the dynamical equations and the poor knowledge of realistic values of the model parameters. The incidence time series of top ten corona infected countries are erratic and sparse. But in comparison, the incidence and disease fitness relationships are uniform and concave upward in nature. These simple profiles with the acceleration curves have fundamental implications in understanding the instinctive dynamics of the corona pandemic. We propose a simple population dynamics solution based on the incidence-fitness relationship in predicting that a plateau or steady state of SARS-CoV-2 will be reached using the basic concept of geometry.",Epidemic Forecasting

This study is a first comprehensive, high-resolution investigation of spatiotemporal heterogeneities on the effect of the Wuhan lockdown on the risk of COVID-19 symptom onset in all 347 Chinese cities. An extended Weight Kernel Density Estimation model was developed to predict the COVID-19 onset risk under two scenarios (i.e., with and without the Wuhan lockdown). The Wuhan lockdown, compared with the scenario without lockdown implementation, in general, delayed the arrival of the COVID-19 onset risk peak for 1-2 days and lowered risk peak values among all cities. The decrease of the onset risk attributed to the lockdown was more than 8% in over 40% of Chinese cities, and up to 21.3% in some cities.

India is currently among the worst-hit nations worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ranks just behind Brazil and the USA. The prediction of the future course of the pandemic is thus of utmost importance in order to prevent further worsening of the situation. In this paper, we develop models for the past trajectory (March 01, 2020-July 25, 2020) and also make a month-long (July 26, 2020-August 24, 2020) forecast of the future evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in India by using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. We determine the most optimal ARIMA model (ARIMA(7,2,2)) based on the statistical parameters viz. root-mean-squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ). Subsequently, the developed model is used to obtain a one month-long forecast for the cumulative cases, active cases, recoveries, and the number of fatalities. According to our forecasting results, India is likely to have 3800,989 cumulative infected cases, 1634,142 cumulative active cases, 2110,697 cumulative recoveries, and 56,150 cumulative deaths by August 24, 2020, if the current trend of the pandemic continues to prevail. The implications of these forecasts are that in the upcoming month, the infection rate of COVID-19 in India is going to escalate, while the rate of recovery and the case-fatality rate is likely to reduce. In order to avert these possible scenarios, the administration and health-care personnel need to formulate and implement robust control measures, while the general public needs to be more responsible and strictly adhere to the established and newly formulated guidelines in order to slow down the spread of the pandemic and prevent it from transforming into a catastrophe.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Based on the publicly available contact-tracing data, we identified 509 transmission chains from 20 provinces in China and estimated the serial interval (SI) and generation interval (GI) of COVID-19 in China. Inspired by different possible values of the time-varying reproduction number for the imported cases and the local cases in China, we divided all transmission events into three subsets: imported (the zeroth generation) infecting 1st-generation locals, 1st-generation locals infecting 2nd-generation locals, and other transmissions among 2+. The corresponding SI (GI) is respectively denoted as SI 1 0 ( GI 1 0 ), SI 2 1 ( GI 2 1 ), and SI 3 + 2 + ( GI 3 + 2 + ). A Bayesian approach with doubly interval-censored likelihood is employed to fit the distribution function of the SI and GI. It was found that the estimated SI 1 0 = 6 . 52 ( 95 % CI : 5 . 96 - 7 . 13 ) , SI 2 1 = 6 . 01 ( 95 % CI : 5 . 44 - 6 . 64 ) , SI 3 + 2 + = 4 . 39 ( 95 % CI : 3 . 74 - 5 . 15 ) , and GI 1 0 = 5 . 47 ( 95 % CI : 4 . 57 - 6 . 45 ) , GI 2 1 = 5 . 01 ( 95 % CI : 3 . 58 - 7 . 06 ) , GI 3 + 2 + = 4 . 25 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 82 - 6 . 23 ) .

We use daily confirmed cases, active cases, recovered cases, deceased cases, Case-Fatality-Rate (CFR), and infectious time as inputs for the model. Furthermore, we define a Transmission Index (TI) as a ratio between the instantaneous and the maximum value of the effective reproduction number. The value of TI indicates the ""effectiveness"" of the disease transmission from a contact between a susceptible and an infectious individual in the presence of current measures, such as physical distancing and lock-down, relative to a normal condition. Based on the value of TI, we forecast different scenarios to see the effect of relaxing and tightening public measures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We proposed a spatio-temporal attention network (STAN) for pandemic prediction. It uses a graph attention network to capture spatio-temporal trends of disease dynamics and to predict the number of cases for a fixed number of days into the future. We also designed a dynamics-based loss term for enhancing long-term predictions. STAN was tested using both real-world patient claims data and COVID-19 statistics over time across US counties. RESULTS: STAN outperforms traditional epidemiological models such as susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR), susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR), and deep learning models on both long-term and short-term predictions, achieving up to 87% reduction in mean squared error compared to the best baseline prediction model.

33481956,Effects of short-term travel on COVID-19 spread: A novel SEIR model and case study in Minnesota.,,"The novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 was first identified in Hubei Province, China in December, 2019. Within a matter of months the virus had spread and become a global pandemic. In addition to international air travel, local travel (e.g. by passenger car) contributes to the geographic spread of COVID-19. We modify the common susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) virus spread model and investigate the extent to which short-term travel associated with driving influences the spread of the virus. We consider the case study of the US state of Minnesota, and calibrated the proposed model with travel and viral spread data. Using our modified SEIR model that considers local short-term travel, we are able to better explain the virus spread than using the long-term travel SEIR model. Short-term travel associated with driving is predicted to be a significant contributor to the historical and future spread of COVID-19. The calibrated model also predicts the proportion of infections that were detected. We find that if driving trips remain at current levels, a substantial increase in COVID-19 cases may be observed in Minnesota, while decreasing intrastate travel could help contain the virus spread.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Here, we estimate the reproduction number throughout the epidemic in Chile and study the effectiveness of control interventions especially the effectiveness of lockdowns by conducting short-term forecasts based on the early transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Chile's incidence curve displays early sub-exponential growth dynamics with the deceleration of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8) and the reproduction number, R, estimated at 1.8 (95% CI: 1.6, 1.9). Our findings indicate that the control measures at the start of the epidemic significantly slowed down the spread of the virus. However, the relaxation of restrictions and spread of the virus in low-income neighborhoods in May led to a new surge of infections, followed by the reimposition of lockdowns in Greater Santiago and other municipalities. These measures have decelerated the virus spread with R estimated at ~0.96 (95% CI: 0.95, 0.98) as of November 2nd, 2020. The early sub-exponential growth trend (p ~0.8) of the COVID-19 epidemic transformed into a linear growth trend (p ~0.5) as of July 7th, 2020, after the reimposition of lockdowns.

33481773,Predictions of COVID-19 dynamics in the UK: Short-term forecasting and analysis of potential exit strategies.,,"Efforts to suppress transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK have seen non-pharmaceutical interventions being invoked. The most severe measures to date include all restaurants, pubs and cafes being ordered to close on 20th March, followed by a ""stay at home"" order on the 23rd March and the closure of all non-essential retail outlets for an indefinite period. Government agencies are presently analysing how best to develop an exit strategy from these measures and to determine how the epidemic may progress once measures are lifted. Mathematical models are currently providing short and long term forecasts regarding the future course of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK to support evidence-based policymaking. We present a deterministic, age-structured transmission model that uses real-time data on confirmed cases requiring hospital care and mortality to provide up-to-date predictions on epidemic spread in ten regions of the UK. The model captures a range of age-dependent heterogeneities, reduced transmission from asymptomatic infections and produces a good fit to the key epidemic features over time. We simulated a suite of scenarios to assess the impact of differing approaches to relaxing social distancing measures from 7th May 2020 on the estimated number of patients requiring inpatient and critical care treatment, and deaths. With regard to future epidemic outcomes, we investigated the impact of reducing compliance, ongoing shielding of elder age groups, reapplying stringent social distancing measures using region based triggers and the role of asymptomatic transmission. We find that significant relaxation of social distancing measures from 7th May onwards can lead to a rapid resurgence of COVID-19 disease and the health system being quickly overwhelmed by a sizeable, second epidemic wave. In all considered age-shielding based strategies, we projected serious demand on critical care resources during the course of the pandemic. The reintroduction and release of strict measures on a regional basis, based on ICU bed occupancy, results in a long epidemic tail, until the second half of 2021, but ensures that the health service is protected by reintroducing social distancing measures for all individuals in a region when required. Our work confirms the effectiveness of stringent non-pharmaceutical measures in March 2020 to suppress the epidemic. It also provides strong evidence to support the need for a cautious, measured approach to relaxation of lockdown measures, to protect the most vulnerable members of society and support the health service through subduing demand on hospital beds, in particular bed occupancy in intensive care units.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Due to limitations in testing coverage, the true extent of the spread may not be fully reflected in the reported cases. In this study, we obtain time-varying estimates of the fraction of COVID-19 infections reported in the different states. METHODS: Following a methodology developed in prior work, we use a delay-adjusted case fatality ratio to estimate the true fraction of cases reported in different states. We also develop a delay adjusted test positivity estimation method and study the relationship between the estimated test positivity rate for each state and the estimated fraction of cases reported. SETTING: We apply this method of analysis to all Indian states reporting at least 100 deaths as of 10 October 2020. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that delay-adjusted case fatality ratios observed in different states range from 0.47% to 3.55%. The estimated fraction of cases reported in different states ranges from 39% to 100% for an assumed baseline case fatality ratio of 1.38%, from 18.6% to 100% for an assumed baseline case fatality ratio of 0.66%, and from 2.8% to 19.7% for an assumed baseline case fatality ratio of 0.1%. We also demonstrate a statistically significant negative relationship between the fraction of cases reported in each state and the testing positivity rate. CONCLUSIONS: The estimates provide a means to quantify and compare the trends of reporting and the true level of current infections in different states.

To understand the impact of COVID-19 on public health, many studies have been conducted for various countries. To complement the available work, in this article we examine Canadian COVID-19 data for the period of March 18, 2020 to August 16, 2020 with the aim to forecast the dynamic trend in a short term. METHOD: We focus our attention on Canadian data and analyze the four provinces, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec, which have the most severe situations in Canada. To build predictive models and conduct prediction, we employ three models, smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) models, neural network (NN) models, and susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) models, to fit time series data of confirmed cases in the four provinces separately. In comparison, we also analyze the data of daily infections in two states of USA, Texas and New York state, for the period of March 18, 2020 to August 16, 2020. We emphasize that different models make different assumptions which are basically difficult to validate. Yet invoking different models allows us to examine the data from different angles, thus, helping reveal the underlying trajectory of the development of COVID-19 in Canada. FINDING: The examinations of the data dated from March 18, 2020 to August 11, 2020 show that the STAR, NN, and SIR models may output different results, though the differences are small in some cases. Prediction over a short term period incurs smaller prediction variability than over a long term period, as expected. The NN method tends to outperform other two methods. All the methods forecast an upward trend in all the four Canadian provinces for the period of August 12, 2020 to August 23, 2020, though the degree varies from method to method.

The spread of COVID-19 is increasing day by day, imposing human lives and economy at risk. Due to the increased enormity of the number of COVID-19 cases, the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is imperative in the current scenario. AI would be a powerful tool to fight against this pandemic outbreak by predicting the number of cases in advance. Deep learning-based time series techniques are considered to predict world-wide COVID-19 cases in advance for short-term and medium-term dependencies with adaptive learning. Initially, the data pre-processing and feature extraction is made with the real world COVID-19 dataset. Subsequently, the prediction of cumulative confirmed, death and recovered global cases are modelled with Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (SLSTM) and Prophet approaches. For long-term forecasting of COVID-19 cases, multivariate LSTM models is employed. The performance metrics are computed for all the models and the prediction results are subjected to comparative analysis to identify the most reliable model. From the results, it is evident that the Stacked LSTM algorithm yields higher accuracy with an error of less than 2% as compared to the other considered algorithms for the studied performance metrics. Country-specific analysis and city-specific analysis of COVID-19 cases for India and Chennai, respectively, are predicted and analyzed in detail. Also, statistical hypothesis analysis and correlation analysis are done on the COVID-19 datasets by including the features like temperature, rainfall, population, total infected cases, area and population density during the months of May, June, July and August to find out the best suitable model. Further, practical significance of predicting COVID-19 cases is elucidated in terms of assessing pandemic characteristics, scenario planning, optimization of models and supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In this study, we conducted a global systematic literature review to summarize trends in the modelling techniques used for Covid-19 from January 1st(,) 2020 to November 30th(,) 2020. We further examined the accuracy and precision of predictions by comparing predicted and observed values for cumulative cases and deaths as well as uncertainties of these predictions. From an initial 4311 peer-reviewed articles and preprints found with our defined keywords, 242 were fully analysed. Most studies were done on Asian (78.93%) and European (59.09%) countries. Most of them used compartmental models (namely SIR and SEIR) (46.1%) and statistical models (growth models and time series) (31.8%) while few used artificial intelligence (6.7%), Bayesian approach (4.7%), Network models (2.3%) and Agent-based models (1.3%). For the number of cumulative cases, the ratio of the predicted over the observed values and the ratio of the amplitude of confidence interval (CI) or credibility interval (CrI) of predictions and the central value were on average larger than 1 indicating cases of inaccurate and imprecise predictions, and large variation across predictions. There was no clear difference among models used for these two ratios. In 75% of predictions that provided CI or CrI, observed values fall within the 95% CI or CrI of the cumulative cases predicted. Only 3.7% of the studies predicted the cumulative number of deaths. For 70% of the predictions, the ratio of predicted over observed cumulative deaths was less or close to 1. Also, the Bayesian model made predictions closer to reality than classical statistical models, although these differences are only suggestive due to the small number of predictions within our dataset (9 in total). In addition, we found a significant negative correlation (rho = - 0.56, p = 0.021) between this ratio and the length (in days) of the period covered by the modelling, suggesting that the longer the period covered by the model the likely more accurate the estimates tend to be.

We use the collected data of the new coronavirus pandemic reported up to 21 September, 2020 in different geographical location countries, which are, China, USA, Russia, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Spain, Bahrain, Egypt, India, Iran, Cyprus and the Syrian Arab Republic. We found that the force of infection and the specific times of SARS-CoV-2 disease are different for different location in countries. We find that there is no actual relation between the force of infection and the specific times of the pandemic of the new coronavirus disease with the weather and the geographical location of the countries.",Epidemic Forecasting

The following features of COVID-19: (a) there exist presymptomatic individuals who have infectivity even during the incubation period, (b) there exist asymptomatic individuals who can freely move around and play crucial roles in the spread of infection, and (c) the duration of immunity may be finite, are incorporated into the SIIR model. The SIIR model has the advantage of being able to explicitly handle asymptomatic individuals who are delayed in discovery or are extremely difficult to be discovered in the real world. It is shown that the conditions for herd immunity in the SIIR model become more severe than those in the SIR model; that is, the presence of asymptomatic individuals increases herd immunity threshold (HIT).",Epidemic Forecasting
33456496,Parameter Estimation and Prediction of COVID-19 Epidemic Turning Point and Ending Time of a Case Study on SIR/SQAIR Epidemic Models.,,"In this paper, the SIR epidemiological model for the COVID-19 with unknown parameters is considered in the first strategy. Three curves (S, I, and R) are fitted to the real data of South Korea, based on a detailed analysis of the actual data of South Korea, taken from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). Using the least square method and minimizing the error between the fitted curve and the actual data, unknown parameters, like the transmission rate, recovery rate, and mortality rate, are estimated. The goodness of fit model is investigated with two criteria (SSE and RMSE), and the uncertainty range of the estimated parameters is also presented. Also, using the obtained determined model, the possible ending time and the turning point of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States are predicted. Due to the lack of treatment and vaccine, in the next strategy, a new group called quarantined people is added to the proposed model. Also, a hidden state, including asymptomatic individuals, which is very common in COVID-19, is considered to make the model more realistic and closer to the real world. Then, the SIR model is developed into the SQAIR model. The delay in the recovery of the infected person is also considered as an unknown parameter. Like the previous steps, the possible ending time and the turning point in the United States are predicted. The model obtained in each strategy for South Korea is compared with the actual data from KDCA to prove the accuracy of the estimation of the parameters.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Each country worldwide has faced this pandemic differently, reflected in its statistical number of confirmed and death cases. Predicting the number of confirmed and death cases could allow us to know the future number of cases and provide each country with the necessary information to make decisions based on the predictions. Recent works are focused only on confirmed COVID-19 cases or a specific country. In this work, the firefly algorithm designs an ensemble neural network architecture for each one of 26 countries. In this work, we propose the firefly algorithm for ensemble neural network optimization applied to COVID-19 time series prediction with type-2 fuzzy logic in a weighted average integration method. The proposed method finds the number of artificial neural networks needed to form an ensemble neural network and their architecture using a type-2 fuzzy inference system to combine the responses of individual artificial neural networks to perform a final prediction.

The total number of Covid-19-infected people in Sao Paulo has reached more than 1 million, while its total death toll stands at 25% of all the country's fatalities. Joining the Brazilian academia efforts in the fight against Covid-19, in this paper we describe a unified framework for monitoring and forecasting the Covid-19 progress in the state of Sao Paulo. More specifically, a freely available, online platform to collect and exploit Covid-19 time-series data is presented, supporting decision-makers while still allowing the general public to interact with data from different regions of the state. Moreover, a novel forecasting data-driven method has also been proposed, by combining the so-called Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased model with machine learning strategies to better fit the mathematical model's coefficients for predicting Infections, Recoveries, Deaths, and Viral Reproduction Numbers. We show that the obtained predictor is capable of dealing with badly conditioned data samples while still delivering accurate 10-day predictions. Our integrated computational system can be used for guiding government actions mainly in two basic aspects: real-time data assessment and dynamic predictions of Covid-19 curves for different regions of the state. We extend our analysis and investigation to inspect the virus spreading in Brazil in its regions.

The objective of this study is to obtain an answer for this important question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different types of immune response. We considered two immune responses: (a) short-lived immunity of all types, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model, and its very modest demands on computational resources, ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released. Our work can also be used to analyse the disease dynamics after a vaccine is certified for use and information regarding its immune response becomes available.",Epidemic Forecasting

This was the first statewide randomized study of COVID-19 testing in the United States. Both PCR and serological tests were administered to all study participants. This paper describes statistical methods used to address nonresponse among various demographic groups and to adjust for testing errors to reduce bias in the estimates of the overall disease prevalence in Indiana. These adjustments were implemented through Bayesian methods, which incorporated all available information on disease prevalence and test performance, along with external data obtained from census of the Indiana statewide population. Both adjustments appeared to have significant impact on the unadjusted estimates, mainly due to upweighting data in study participants of non-White races and Hispanic ethnicity and anticipated false-positive and false-negative test results among both the PCR and antibody tests utilized in the study.",Diagnosis;Epidemic Forecasting
33441091,Evaluation of undetected cases during the COVID-19 epidemic in Austria.,agent-based modelling;covid-19;undetected cases,"BACKGROUND: Knowing the number of undetected cases of COVID-19 is important for a better understanding of the spread of the disease. This study analyses the temporal dynamic of detected vs. undetected cases to provide guidance for the interpretation of prevalence studies performed with PCR or antibody tests to estimate the detection rate. METHODS: We used an agent-based model to evaluate assumptions on the detection probability ranging from 0.1 to 0.9. For each general detection probability, we derived age-dependent detection probabilities and calibrated the model to reproduce the epidemic wave of COVID-19 in Austria from March 2020 to June 2020. We categorized infected individuals into presymptomatic, symptomatic unconfirmed, confirmed and never detected to observe the simulated dynamic of the detected and undetected cases. RESULTS: The calculation of the age-dependent detection probability ruled values lower than 0.4 as most likely. Furthermore, the proportion of undetected cases depends strongly on the dynamic of the epidemic wave: during the initial upswing, the undetected cases account for a major part of all infected individuals, whereas their share decreases around the peak of the confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS: The results of prevalence studies performed to determine the detection rate of COVID-19 patients should always be interpreted with regard to the current dynamic of the epidemic wave. Applying the method proposed in our analysis, the prevalence study performed in Austria in April 2020 could indicate a detection rate of 0.13, instead of the prevalent ratio of 0.29 between detected and estimated undetected cases at that time.",Diagnosis;Epidemic Forecasting

Suddenly, ICU capacity planning became a first-order concern, and the health authorities were in urgent need of tools to estimate the demand for urgent care associated with the pandemic. In this article, we describe the approach we followed to provide such demand forecasts, and we show how the use of analytics can provide relevant support for decision making, even with incomplete data and without enough time to fully explore the numerical properties of all available forecasting methods. The solution combines autoregressive, machine learning and epidemiological models to provide a short-term forecast of ICU utilization at the regional level. These forecasts were made publicly available and were actively used to support capacity planning.

This time-varying growth rate is estimated using the Kalman filter from data on new cases. The method is easy to implement in standard statistical software, and it performs well even when the number of infected individuals is imperfectly measured, or the infection does not follow the SIR model.

The methods used include the derivation of the Pandemic Equation describing the mitigation measures via the evolution of the growth time constant in the Pandemic Equation resulting in an asymmetric pandemic curve with a steeper rise than a decrease and mitigation measures. The Pandemic Equation predicts how the quarantine removal and business opening lead to a spike in the pandemic curve. The effective vaccination reduces the new daily infections predicted by the Pandemic Equation. The pandemic curves in many localities have similar time dependencies but shifted in time. The Pandemic Equation parameters extracted from the well advanced pandemic curves can be used for predicting the pandemic evolution in the localities, where the pandemics is still in the initial stages. Using the multiple pandemic locations for the parameter extraction allows for the uncertainty quantification in predicting the pandemic evolution using the introduced Pandemic Equation. Compared with other pandemic models our approach allows for easier parameter extraction amenable to using Artificial Intelligence models.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

A key research focus is in predicting the development trend of COVID-19 scientifically through mathematical modelling. We conducted a systematic review of epidemic prediction models of COVID-19 and the public health intervention strategies by searching the Web of Science database. 55 studies of the COVID-19 epidemic model were reviewed systematically. It was found that the COVID-19 epidemic models were different in the model type, acquisition method, hypothesis and distribution of key input parameters. Most studies used the gamma distribution to describe the key time period of COVID-19 infection, and some studies used the lognormal distribution, the Erlang distribution, and the Weibull distribution. The setting ranges of the incubation period, serial interval, infectious period and generation time were 4.9-7 days, 4.41-8.4 days, 2.3-10 days and 4.4-7.5 days, respectively, and more than half of the incubation periods were set to 5.1 or 5.2 days. Most models assumed that the latent period was consistent with the incubation period. Some models assumed that asymptomatic infections were infectious or pre-symptomatic transmission was possible, which overestimated the value of R0. For the prediction differences under different public health strategies, the most significant effect was in travel restrictions. There were different studies on the impact of contact tracking and social isolation, but it was considered that improving the quarantine rate and reporting rate, and the use of protective face mask were essential for epidemic prevention and control. The input epidemiological parameters of the prediction models had significant differences in the prediction of the severity of the epidemic spread. Therefore, prevention and control institutions should be cautious when formulating public health strategies by based on the prediction results of mathematical models.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

To study the impact of lockdown on disease dynamics we consider a three-dimensional mathematical model using nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The proposed model has been studied using stability theory of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Basic reproduction ratio is computed and significant parameters responsible to keep basic reproduction ratio less than one are identified.

Strong control is considered due to the social separation. The result is consequently associated with a macroscopic law for the population.

Summarizing the development of COVID-19 and assessing the effects of control measures are very critical to China and other countries. A logistic growth curve model was employed to compare the development of COVID-19 before and after the emergency response took effect. We found that the number of confirmed cases peaked 9-14 days after the first detection of an imported case, but there was a peak lag in the province where the outbreak was concentrated. Results of the growth curves indicated that the fitted cumulative confirmed cases were close to the actual observed cases, and the R(2) of all models was above 0.95. The average growth rate decreased by 44.42% nationally and by 32.5% outside Hubei Province. The average growth rate in the 12 high-risk areas decreased by 29.9%. The average growth rate of cumulative confirmed cases decreased by approximately 50% after the emergency response. Areas with frequent population migration have a high risk of outbreak.

Global case importations from China in early January came primarily from Wuhan, but the inferred source shifted to other cities in mid-February, especially for importations to African destinations. We estimate that 10.4 (6.2 - 27.1) COVID-19 cases were imported to these African destinations, which exhibited marked variation in their magnitude and main sources of importation. We estimate that 90% of imported cases arrived between 17 January and 7 February, prior to the first case detections.

The trajectory of the global spread is worrisome, particularly in heavily populated countries such as Nigeria. The study objective was to assess and compare the pattern of COVID-19 spread in Nigeria and seven other countries during the first 120 days of the outbreak. METHODS: Data was extracted from the World Bank's website. A descriptive analysis was conducted as well as modelling of COVID-19 spread from day one through day 120 in Nigeria and seven other countries. Model fitting was conducted using linear, quadratic, cubic and exponential regression methods (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: The COVID-19 spread pattern in Nigeria was similar to the patterns in Egypt, Ghana and Cameroun. The daily death distribution in Nigeria was similar to those of six out of the seven countries considered. There was an increasing trend in the daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Nigeria. During the lockdown, the growth rate in Nigeria was 5.85 (R(2)=0.728, p< 0.001); however, it was 8.42 (R(2)=0.625, p< 0.001) after the lockdown was relaxed. The cubic polynomial model (CPM) provided the best fit for predicting COVID-19 cumulative cases across all the countries investigated and there was a clear deviation from the exponential growth model. Using the CPM, the predicted number of cases in Nigeria at 3-month (30 September 2020) was 155,467 (95% CI:151,111-159,824, p< 0.001), all things being equal.

The spread of the disease has been on the increase across the globe for some time with no end in sight. The research used the data of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria for the numerical simulation which has been fitted to the model. We brought in the consideration of both asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals with the fact that an exposed individual is either sent to quarantine first or move to one of the infected classes with the possibility that susceptible individual can also move to quarantined class directly. It was found that the proposed model has two equilibrium points; the disease-free equilibrium point ( DFE ) and the endemic equilibrium point ( E 1 ) . Stability analysis of the equilibrium points shows ( E 0 ) is locally asymptotically stable whenever the basic reproduction number, R 0 < 1 and ( E 1 ) is globally asymptotically stable whenever R 0 > 1 . Sensitivity analysis of the parameters in the R 0 was conducted and the profile of each state variable was also depicted using the fitted values of the parameters showing the spread of the disease. The most sensitive parameters in the R 0 are the contact rate between susceptible individuals and the rate of transfer of individuals from exposed class to symptomatically infected class. Moreover, the basic reproduction number for the data is calculated as R 0 approximately 1.7031 . Existence and uniqueness of solution established via the technique of fixed point theorem.

Although the lockdown is effective in such prevention, it may put the economy into a depression. Predicting the epidemic progression with the government switching the lockdown on or off is critical. We propose a transfer learning approach called ALeRT-COVID using attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to predict the epidemic trends for different countries. A source model was trained on the pre-defined source countries and then transferred to each target country. The lockdown measure was introduced to our model as a predictor and the attention mechanism was utilized to learn the different contributions of the confirmed cases in the past days to the future trend. Results demonstrated that the transfer learning strategy is helpful especially for early-stage countries. By introducing the lockdown predictor and the attention mechanism, ALeRT-COVID showed a significant improvement in the prediction performance. We predicted the confirmed cases in 1 week when extending and easing lockdown separately. Our results show that lockdown measures are still necessary for several countries. We expect our research can help different countries to make better decisions on the lockdown measures.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The study's primary motivation is to be able to estimate with a certain level of accuracy the number of deaths due to COVID-19, managing to model the progression of the pandemic. Predicting the number of possible deaths from COVID-19 can provide governments and decision-makers with indicators for purchasing respirators and pandemic prevention policies.

The two intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try to reduce the disease reproductive number, R 0 , to a target value R 0 target < 1 , but in distinct ways, which we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same R 0 target < 1 , TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than SD. However, for TQ to be effective, it has to be based on contact tracing and our study quantifies the required ratio of tests-per-day to the number of new cases-per-day. Our analysis shows that the largest eigenvalue of the linearised dynamics provides a simple understanding of the disease progression, both pre- and post- intervention, and explains observed data for many countries. We apply our results to the COVID data for India to obtain heuristic projections for the course of the pandemic, and note that the predictions strongly depend on the assumed fraction of asymptomatic carriers.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Since then, 26,795,847 cases have been reported worldwide, and 878,963 lost their lives due to the illness by September 3, 2020. Prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic will enable policymakers to optimize the use of healthcare system capacity and resource allocation to minimize the fatality rate. In this research, we design a novel hybrid reinforcement learning-based algorithm capable of solving complex optimization problems. We apply our algorithm to several well-known benchmarks and show that the proposed methodology provides quality solutions for most complex benchmarks. Besides, we show the dominance of the offered method over state-of-the-art methods through several measures. Moreover, to demonstrate the suggested method's efficiency in optimizing real-world problems, we implement our approach to the most recent data from Quebec, Canada, to predict the COVID-19 outbreak. Our algorithm, combined with the most recent mathematical model for COVID-19 pandemic prediction, accurately reflected the future trend of the pandemic with a mean square error of 6.29E-06. Furthermore, we generate several scenarios for deepening our insight into pandemic growth. We determine essential factors and deliver various managerial insights to help policymakers making decisions regarding future social measures.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Application to the case of Italy.,theta -seiqhrd model;covid-19;effective reproduction number;numerical simulation;parameter estimation;sars-cov-2,"Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in China many models have appeared in the literature, trying to simulate its dynamics. Focusing on modeling the biological and sociological mechanisms which influence the disease spread, the basic reference example is the SIR model. However, it is too simple to be able to model those mechanisms (including the three main types of control measures: social distancing, contact tracing and health system measures) to fit real data and to simulate possible future scenarios. A question, then, arises: how much and how do we need to complexify a SIR model? We develop a theta -SEIHQRD model, which may be the simplest one satisfying the mentioned requirements for arbitrary territories and can be simplified in particular cases. We show its very good performance in the Italian case and study different future scenarios.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Reliable and accurate short and long-term forecasts of COVID-19 cases and deaths, both at the national and provincial level, are a key aspect of the strategy to handle the COVID-19 epidemic in the country. METHODS: In this paper we apply the previously validated approach of phenomenological models, fitting several non-linear growth curves (Richards, 3 and 4 parameter logistic, Weibull and Gompertz), to produce short term forecasts of COVID-19 cases and deaths at the national level as well as the provincial level. Using publicly available daily reported cumulative case and death data up until 22 June 2020, we report 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30-day ahead forecasts of cumulative cases and deaths. All predictions are compared to the actual observed values in the forecasting period. RESULTS: We observed that all models for cases provided accurate and similar short-term forecasts for a period of 5 days ahead at the national level, and that the three and four parameter logistic growth models provided more accurate forecasts than that obtained from the Richards model 10 days ahead. However, beyond 10 days all models underestimated the cumulative cases. Our forecasts across the models predict an additional 23,551-26,702 cases in 5 days and an additional 47,449-57,358 cases in 10 days. While the three parameter logistic growth model provided the most accurate forecasts of cumulative deaths within the 10 day period, the Gompertz model was able to better capture the changes in cumulative deaths beyond this period. Our forecasts across the models predict an additional 145-437 COVID-19 deaths in 5 days and an additional 243-947 deaths in 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: By comparing both the predictions of deaths and cases to the observed data in the forecasting period, we found that this modeling approach provides reliable and accurate forecasts for a maximum period of 10 days ahead.",Epidemic Forecasting

33421047,Time Series Forecasting of US COVID-19 Transmission.,,"Context: The increasing number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally is shocking every day. US daily deaths have numbered over one-thousand people per day for nearly 3 days (from November 18, 2020 to November 20, 2020), and total deaths have exceeded 250 000 as of November 21, 2020, which drives the medical community to search for trends to provide an early warning of rising numbers of cases and to prevent future increases. Objective: The study intended to evaluate available US COVID-19 data to determine the possibility of predicting the spread of COVID-19 in the USA. Design: The research team collected US COVID-19 data from a time-series view and established a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model to predict trends. Results: According to the spatial and temporal distribution of cumulative confirmed cases, US COVID-19 cases are mainly concentrated in areas with high population density, with that variable having a positive correlation to the number of confirmed cases and deaths. The correlation coefficients are 0.95 and 0.817, respectively, indicating that the transmission of COVID-19 in the USA is characterized by agglomeration. After exploring the impact of population density, the research team established a SARIMA model to predict the trends, finding that US COVID-19 cases will continue to go up. Conclusions: By combining knowledge of the statistical features of the virus with modeling findings, the study determined a method that can improve understanding of the serious pandemic, paving the way toward the development of predictive and preventative solutions.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

We propose a model-based approach to calculate cumulative infection rates from data on observed and expected deaths from Covid-19. Our analysis of mortality data shows that 7% of people in Great Britain were infected by Covid-19 by the last third of June 2020. It is unlikely that the infection rate was lower than 4% or higher than 15%. Secondly, England had higher infection rates than Scotland and especially Wales, although the differences between countries were not large. Thirdly, we observed a substantial variation in virus infection rates in Great Britain by geographical units. Estimated infection rates were highest in the capital city of London where between 11 and 12% of the population might have been infected and also in other major urban regions, while the lowest were in small towns and rural areas. Finally, spatial regression analysis showed that the virus infection rates increased with the increasing population density of the area and the level of deprivation. The results suggest that people from lower socioeconomic groups in urban areas (including those with minority backgrounds) were most affected by the spread of coronavirus from March to June.",Epidemic Forecasting

The concentration of NO2 linked to COVID-19-related deaths in three major French cities were determined using Artificial Neural Networks experiments and a Causal Direction from Dependency (D2C) algorithm. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential effects of NO2 in spreading the epidemic. The underlying hypothesis is that NO2, as a precursor to secondary particulate matter formation, can foster COVID-19 and make the respiratory system more susceptible to this infection. Three different neural networks for the cities of Paris, Lyon and Marseille were built in this work, followed by the application of an innovative tool of cutting the signal from the inputs to the selected target. The results show that the threshold levels of NO2 connected to COVID-19 range between 15.8 mug/m(3) for Lyon, 21.8 mug/m(3) for Marseille and 22.9 mug/m(3) for Paris, which were significantly lower than the average annual concentration limit of 40 mug/m(3) imposed by Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament.",Epidemic Forecasting

However, often ignored complexities have generated confusion around use of the metric. This is particularly apparent with the emergent pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We address some misconceptions about the predictive ability of the reproductive number, focusing on how it changes over time, varies over space, and relates to epidemic size by referencing the mathematical definition of R and examples from the current pandemic.

We proposed an SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) model to analyze the epidemic trend in Wuhan and use the AI model to analyze the epidemic trend in non-Wuhan areas. We found that if the closure was lifted, the outbreak in non-Wuhan areas of mainland China would double in size.

To explore the impact of intervention measures on the COVID-19 epidemic, we established susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) models to predict the epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 at four different phases (beginning, outbreak, recession, and plateau) from January 1st to March 30th, 2020. We found that the infection rate rapidly grew up to 0.3647 at Phase II from 0.1100 at Phase I and went down to 0.0600 and 0.0006 at Phase III and IV, respectively. The reproduction numbers of COVID-19 were 10.7843, 13.8144, 1.4815, and 0.0137 at Phase I, II, III, and IV, respectively. These results suggest that intensive interventions, including compulsory home isolation and rapid improvement of medical resources, can effectively reduce the COVID-19 transmission. Furthermore, the predicted COVID-19 epidemic trend by our models was close to the actual epidemic trend in Wuhan. Our phase-based SEIR models demonstrate that intensive intervention measures can effectively control COVID-19 spread even without specific medicines and vaccines against this disease.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

With the global epidemic dynamics becoming more and more serious, the prediction and analysis of the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 has become an important task. We develop an artificial neural network (ANN) for modeling of the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19. The confirmed cases and deaths data are collected from January 20 to November 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). By introducing root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R), and mean absolute error (MAE), statistical indicators of the prediction model are verified and evaluated. The size of training and test confirmed cases and death base employed in the model is optimized. The best simulating performance with RMSE, R, and MAE is realized using the 7 past days' cases as input variables in the training and test dataset. And the estimated R are 0.9948 and 0.9683, respectively. Compared with different algorithms, experimental simulation shows that trainbr algorithm has better performance than other algorithms in reproducing the amount of the confirmed cases and deaths. This study shows that the ANN model is suitable for predicting the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in the future. Using the ANN model, we also predict the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 from June 5, 2020 to November 11, 2020. During the predicting period, the R, RMSE, and MAE for new infected confirmed cases of COVID-19 are 0.9848, 17,554, and 12,229, respectively; the R, RMSE, and MAE for new confirmed deaths of COVID-19 are 0.8593, 631.8, and 463.7, respectively.

DESIGN: Open-source age-structured variant of a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered compartmental mathematical model. Latin hypercube sampling and maximum likelihood estimation were used to calibrate to cumulative cases and cumulative deaths. SETTING: SW at a time considered early in the pandemic, where National Health Service authorities required evidence to guide localised planning and support decision-making. PARTICIPANTS: Publicly available data on patients with COVID-19. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The expected numbers of infected cases, deaths due to COVID-19 infection, patient occupancy of acute and IC beds and the reproduction ('R') number over time. RESULTS: SW model projections indicate that, as of 11 May 2020 (when 'lockdown' measures were eased), 5793 (95% credible interval (CrI) 2003 to 12 051) individuals were still infectious (0.10% of the total SW population, 95% CrI 0.04% to 0.22%), and a total of 189 048 (95% CrI 141 580 to 277 955) had been infected with the virus (either asymptomatically or symptomatically), but recovered, which is 3.4% (95% CrI 2.5% to 5.0%) of the SW population. The total number of patients in acute and IC beds in the SW on 11 May 2020 was predicted to be 701 (95% CrI 169 to 1543) and 110 (95% CrI 8 to 464), respectively. The R value in SW was predicted to be 2.6 (95% CrI 2.0 to 3.2) prior to any interventions, with social distancing reducing this to 2.3 (95% CrI 1.8 to 2.9) and lockdown/school closures further reducing the R value to 0.6 (95% CrI 0.5 to 0.7).

Population migration increases the risk of epidemic transmission. Here, the objective of study is to estimate the output risk quantitatively and evaluate the effectiveness of travel restrictions of Wuhan city. METHODS: We proposed a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) dynamics model to predict the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in Wuhan. And, subsequently, we estimated the export risk of COVID-19 epidemic from Wuhan to other provinces in China. Finally, we estimated the effectiveness of travel restrictions of Wuhan city quantitatively by the export risk on the assumption that the measure was postponed. RESULTS: The export risks of COVID-19 varied from Wuhan to other provinces of China. The peak of export risk was January 21-23, 2020. With the travel restrictions of Wuhan delayed by 3, 5, and 7 d, the export risk indexes will increase by 38.50%, 55.89%, and 65.63%, respectively.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently spreading around the world. The relationships among the pandemic and its associated travel restrictions, social distancing measures, contact tracing, mask-wearing habits and medical consultation efficiency have not yet been extensively assessed. Based on the epidemic data reported by the Health Commission of Wenzhou, we analysed the developmental characteristics of the epidemic and modified the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model in three discrete ways. (1) According to the implemented preventive measures, the epidemic was divided into three stages: initial, outbreak and controlled. (2) We added many factors, such as health protections, travel restrictions and social distancing, close-contact tracing and the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation (TSOH), to the model. (3) Exposed and infected people were subdivided into isolated and free-moving populations. For the parameter estimation of the model, the average TSOH and daily cured cases, deaths and imported cases can be obtained through individual data from epidemiological investigations. The changes in daily contacts are simulated using the intracity travel intensity (ICTI) from the Baidu Migration Big Data platform. The optimal values of the remaining parameters are calculated by the grid search method. With this model, we calculated the sensitivity of the control measures with regard to the prevention of the spread of the epidemic by simulating the number of infected people in various hypothetical situations. Simultaneously, through a simulation of a second epidemic, the challenges from the rebound of the epidemic were analysed, and prevention and control recommendations were made. The results show that the modified SEIR model can effectively simulate the spread of COVID-19 in Wenzhou. The policy of the lockdown of Wuhan, the launch of the first-level Public Health Emergency Preparedness measures on 23 January 2020 and the implementation of resident travel control measures on 31 January 2020 were crucial to COVID-19 control.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Models based on these acquired data may suffer from systematic errors and large estimation variances due to the biases associated with testing. An unbiased randomized testing to estimate the true fatality rate is still missing. METHODS: Here, we characterize the effect of incidental sampling bias in the estimation of epidemic dynamics. Towards this, we explicitly modeled for sampling bias in an augmented compartment model to predict epidemic dynamics. We further calculate the bias from differences in disease prediction from biased, and randomized sampling, proposing a strategy to obtain unbiased estimates. RESULTS: Our simulations demonstrate that sampling biases in favor of patients with higher disease manifestation could significantly affect direct estimates of infection and fatality rates calculated from the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, and serological testing can partially mitigate these biased estimates. CONCLUSIONS: The augmented compartmental model allows the explicit modeling of different testing policies and their effects on disease estimates. Our calculations for the dependence of expected confidence on a randomized sample sizes, show that relatively small sample sizes can provide statistically significant estimates for SARS-CoV-2 related death rates.",Epidemic Forecasting

DESIGN: the study introduces a SEIR compartmental model, taking into account the region-specific fraction of undetected cases, the effects of mobility restrictions, and the personal protective measures adopted, such as wearing a mask and washing hands frequently. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the model is experimentally validated with data of all the Italian regions, some European countries, and the US. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the accuracy of the model results is measured through the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and Lewis criteria; fitting parameters are in good agreement with previous literature. RESULTS: the epidemic curves for different countries and the amount of undetected and asymptomatic cases are estimated, which are likely to represent the main source of infections in the near future. The model is applied to the Hubei case study, which is the first place to relax mobility restrictions. Results show different possible scenarios. Mobility and the adoption of personal protective measures greatly influence the dynamics of the infection, determining either a huge and rapid secondary epidemic peak or a more delayed and manageable one.

33412802,[Analysis and future scenarios of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Tuscany Region (Central Italy)].,sird;basic reproduction number;compartmental models;projections sars-cov-2.,"OBJECTIVES: about two months after the end of the lockdown imposed for the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the contagion dynamics in the Tuscany Region (Central Italy) have been assessed from the beginning of the emergency to the end of June through a compartmental model, and future medium-long term projections have been produced. DATA AND METHODS: this study used a SIRD model in which the infection reproduction number R0 varied over time, according to a piecewise constant function. The fatality parameter and the time from contagion to infection resolution (death or recovery) were fixed to ensure parameter identifiability, and the model was calibrated on the Covid-19 deaths notified from March 9th to June 30th 2020. The uncertainty around the estimates was quantified through parametric bootstrap. Finally, the resulting model was used to produce medium-long term projections of the epidemic dynamics. RESULTS: the date of the first infection in Tuscany was estimated as February 21st 2020. The value of R0(t) ranged from 7.78 (95%CI 7.55-7.89), at the beginning of the outbreak, to a value very close to 0 between April 27th and May 17th. Finally, R0(t) rose, reaching an average of 0.66 (0.32, 0.88) between May 18th and June 30th. At the epidemic peak, estimated at the beginning of April, the notified infected people circulating in the region were just 22% of those predicted by the model. According to the estimated SIRD, under the hypothetical scenario that R0(t) slightly exceeds 1 from the beginning of October 2020, a new wave of contagion could arise by next spring. CONCLUSIONS: the estimated trend of R0(t) is suggestive of a strong effect of the lockdown in Tuscany and of a mild increase of the contagion potentially attributable to the easing of the containment measures. Medium-long term projections unequivocally indicate that the danger of a new epidemic wave has not been averted.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

A common approach to this problem involves fitting daily transmission rates using a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-(SEIR) model (regularizing to avoid overfitting) and then computing the relationship between the estimated transmission rate and mobility. Unfortunately, there are often several very different transmission-rate trajectories that can fit the reported cases well, meaning that the choice of regularization determines the final solution (and thus the mobility-transmission rate relationship) selected by the SEIR model. Moreover, the classical approaches to regularization-penalizing the derivative of the transmission rate trajectory-do not correspond to realistic properties of pandemic spread. Consequently, models fitted using derivative-based regularization are often biased toward underestimating the current transmission rate and future deaths. In this work, we propose mobility-driven regularization of the SEIR transmission rate trajectory. This method rectifies the artificial regularization problem, produces more accurate and unbiased forecasts of future deaths, and estimates a highly interpretable relationship between mobility and the transmission rate. For this analysis, mobility data related to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic was collected by Safegraph (San Francisco, California) from major US cities between March and August 2020.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

The ability to predict the progress of this pandemic has been crucial for decision making aimed at fighting this pandemic and controlling its spread. In this work we considered four different statistical/time series models that are readily available from the 'forecast' package in R. We performed novel applications with these models, forecasting the number of infected cases (confirmed cases and similarly the number of deaths and recovery) along with the corresponding 90% prediction interval to estimate uncertainty around pointwise forecasts. Since the future may not repeat the past for this pandemic, no prediction model is certain. However, any prediction tool with acceptable prediction performance (or prediction error) could still be very useful for public-health planning to handle spread of the pandemic, and could policy decision-making and facilitate transition to normality. These four models were applied to publicly available data of the COVID-19 pandemic for both the USA and Italy. We observed that all models reasonably predicted the future numbers of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries of COVID-19. However, for the majority of the analyses, the time series model with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and cubic smoothing spline models both had smaller prediction errors and narrower prediction intervals, compared to the Holt and Trigonometric Exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation (TBATS) models. Therefore, the former two models were preferable to the latter models. Given similarities in performance of the models in the USA and Italy, the corresponding prediction tools can be applied to other countries grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, and to any pandemics that can occur in future.",Epidemic Forecasting
33411737,Robust estimation of diagnostic rate and real incidence of COVID-19 for European policymakers.,,"Policymakers need clear, fast assessment of the real spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in each of their respective countries. Standard measures of the situation provided by the governments include reported positive cases and total deaths. While total deaths indicate immediately that countries like Italy and Spain had the worst situation as of mid-April, 2020, reported cases alone do not provide a complete picture of the situation. Different countries diagnose differently and present very distinctive reported case fatality ratios. Similar levels of reported incidence and mortality might hide a very different underlying pictures. Here we present a straightforward and robust estimation of the diagnostic rate in each European country. From that estimation we obtain a uniform, unbiased incidence of the epidemic. The method to obtain the diagnostic rate is transparent and empirical. The key assumption of the method is that the infection fatality ratio of COVID-19 in Europe is not strongly country-dependent. We show that this number is not expected to be biased due to demography nor to the way total deaths are reported. The estimation protocol is dynamic, and it has been yielding converging numbers for diagnostic rates in all European countries as from mid-April, 2020.

33406533,Estimating the Effect of Social Distancing Interventions on COVID-19 in the United States.,bayesian hierarchical model;intervention effect size;reproduction number;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;social isolation,"Since its global emergence in 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused multiple epidemics in the United States. When medical treatments for the virus were still emerging and a vaccine was not yet available, state and local governments sought to limit its spread by enacting various social-distancing interventions, such as school closures and lockdowns; however, the effectiveness of these interventions was unknown. We applied an established, semimechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model of these interventions to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from Europe to the United States, using case fatalities from February 29, 2020, up to April 25, 2020, when some states began reversing their interventions. We estimated the effects of interventions across all states, contrasted the estimated reproduction numbers before and after lockdown for each state, and contrasted the predicted number of future fatalities with the actual number of fatalities as a check of the model's validity. Overall, school closures and lockdowns were the only interventions modeled that had a reliable impact on the time-varying reproduction number, and lockdown appears to have played a key role in reducing that number to below 1.0. We conclude that reversal of lockdown without implementation of additional, equally effective interventions will enable continued, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33406106,Optimal periodic closure for minimizing risk in emerging disease outbreaks.,,"Without vaccines and treatments, societies must rely on non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies to control the spread of emerging diseases such as COVID-19. Though complete lockdown is epidemiologically effective, because it eliminates infectious contacts, it comes with significant costs. Several recent studies have suggested that a plausible compromise strategy for minimizing epidemic risk is periodic closure, in which populations oscillate between wide-spread social restrictions and relaxation. However, no underlying theory has been proposed to predict and explain optimal closure periods as a function of epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we develop such an analytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how characteristic closure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increase predictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a disease- as long as both are within predictable limits. Using our approach we demonstrate a sweet-spot effect in which optimal periodic closure is maximally effective for diseases with similar incubation and recovery periods. Our results compare well to numerical simulations, including in COVID-19 models where infectivity and recovery show significant variation.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33406102,"Relaxation of social distancing restrictions: Model estimated impact on COVID-19 epidemic in Manitoba, Canada.",,"OBJECTIVES: The unprecedented worldwide social distancing response to COVID-19 resulted in a quick reversal of escalating case numbers. Recently, local governments globally have begun to relax social distancing regulations. Using the situation in Manitoba, Canada as an example, we estimated the impact that social distancing relaxation may have on the pandemic. METHODS: We fit a mathematical model to empirically estimated numbers of people infected, recovered, and died from COVID-19 in Manitoba. We then explored the impact of social distancing relaxation on: (a) time until near elimination of COVID-19 (< one case per million), (b) time until peak prevalence, (c) proportion of the population infected within one year, (d) peak prevalence, and (e) deaths within one year. RESULTS: Assuming a closed population, near elimination of COVID-19 in Manitoba could have been achieved in 4-6 months (by July or August) if there were no relaxation of social distancing. Relaxing to 15% of pre-COVID effective contacts may extend the local epidemic for more than two years (median 2.1). Relaxation to 50% of pre-COVID effective contacts may result in a peak prevalence of 31-38% of the population, within 3-4 months of initial relaxation. CONCLUSION: Slight relaxation of social distancing may immensely impact the pandemic duration and expected peak prevalence. Only holding the course with respect to social distancing may have resulted in near elimination before Fall of 2020; relaxing social distancing to 15% of pre-COVID-19 contacts will flatten the epidemic curve but greatly extend the duration of the pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Due to the lack of anti-COVID-19 therapies, decision-makers require timely and accurate data to estimate the incidence of disease and the availability of hospital resources to contain the pandemic. Methods: We adapted an existing model to the local context to forecast COVID-19 incidence and hospital resource use assuming different scenarios: (1) the implementation of quarantine from September 1(st) to October 15(th) (average daily growth rate of 2%); (2-3) partial restrictions (at 4% and 8% growth rates); and (4) no restrictions, assuming a 10% growth rate. Previous scenarios with predictions from June to August were also presented. We estimated the number of new cases, diagnostic tests required, and the number of available hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds (with and without ventilators) for each scenario. Results: We estimated 67,700 cases by October 15(th) when assuming the implementation of a quarantine, 80,400 and 101,500 cases when assuming partial restrictions at 4% and 8% infection rates, respectively, and 208,500 with no restrictions. According to different scenarios, the estimated demand for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests ranged from 202,000 to 1,610,600 between September 1(st) and October 15(th). The model predicted depletion of hospital and ICU beds by September 20(th) if all restrictions were to be lifted and the infection growth rate increased to 10%. Conclusion: Slowly lifting social distancing restrictions and reopening the economy is not expected to result in full resource depletion by October if the daily growth rate is maintained below 8%. Increasing the number of available beds provides a safeguard against slightly higher infection rates. Predictive models can be iteratively used to obtain nuanced predictions to aid decision-making.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33402722,Estimating and explaining the spread of COVID-19 at the county level in the USA.,,"The basic reproduction number, R0, determines the rate of spread of a communicable disease and therefore gives fundamental information needed to plan public health interventions. Using mortality records, we estimated the rate of spread of COVID-19 among 160 counties and county-aggregates in the USA at the start of the epidemic. We show that most of the high among-county variance is explained by four factors (R(2) = 0.70): the timing of outbreak, population size, population density, and spatial location. For predictions of future spread, population density and spatial location are important, and for the latter we show that SARS-CoV-2 strains containing the G614 mutation to the spike gene are associated with higher rates of spread. Finally, the high predictability of R0 allows extending estimates to all 3109 counties in the conterminous 48 states. The high variation of R0 argues for public health policies enacted at the county level for controlling COVID-19.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Objective: To estimate the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US as of November 15, 2020. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study of respondents of all ages, data from 4 regional and 1 nationwide Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seroprevalence surveys (April [n = 16596], May, June, and July [n = 40817], and August [n = 38355]) were used to estimate infection underreporting multipliers and symptomatic underreporting multipliers. Community serosurvey data from randomly selected members of the general population were also used to validate the underreporting multipliers. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. The median of underreporting multipliers derived from the 5 CDC seroprevalence surveys in the 10 states that participated in 2 or more surveys were applied to surveillance data of reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases for 5 respective time periods to derive estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections, which were summed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections in the US. Estimates of infections and symptomatic infections were combined with estimates of the hospitalization ratio and fatality ratio to derive estimates of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalizations and deaths. External validity of the surveys was evaluated with the April CDC survey by comparing results to 5 serosurveys (n = 22118) that used random sampling of the general population. Internal validity of the multipliers from the 10 specific states was assessed in the August CDC survey by comparing multipliers from the 10 states to all states. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the interquartile range of the multipliers to derive a high and low estimate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections. The underreporting multipliers were then used to adjust the reported COVID-19 infections to estimate the full SARS-COV-2 disease burden. Results: Adjusting reported COVID-19 infections using underreporting multipliers derived from CDC seroprevalence studies in April (n = 16596), May (n = 14291), June (n = 14159), July (n = 12367), and August (n = 38355), there were estimated medians of 46910006 (interquartile range [IQR], 38192705-60814748) SARS-CoV-2 infections, 28122752 (IQR, 23014957-36438592) symptomatic infections, 956174 (IQR, 782509-1238912) hospitalizations, and 304915 (IQR, 248253-395296) deaths in the US through November 15, 2020. An estimated 14.3% (IQR, 11.6%-18.5%) of the US population were infected by SARS-CoV-2 as of mid-November 2020. Conclusions and Relevance: The SARS-CoV-2 disease burden may be much larger than reported COVID-19 cases owing to underreporting. Even after adjusting for underreporting, a substantial gap remains between the estimated proportion of the population infected and the proportion infected required to reach herd immunity. Additional seroprevalence surveys are needed to monitor the pandemic, including after the introduction of safe and efficacious vaccines.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

On the basis of an exponential decay model (EDM), we provide estimations of the WR in four-time intervals from February 27 to April 07, 2020. By calibrating the parameters of the EDM to the reported data in Hubei Province of China, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak. We compare the EDM applied to WR and the Gompertz model, which is based on exponential decay and is often used to estimate cumulative events. Specifically, we assess the performance of each model to short-term forecast of the epidemic, and to predict the final epidemic size. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the model applied to data from February 27 until the 17th of March estimate that the cumulative number of infected in Italy could reach 131,280 (with a credibility interval 71,415-263,501) by April 25 (credibility interval April 12 to May 3). With the data available until the 24st of March the peak date should be reached on May 3 (April 23 to May 23) with 197,179 cumulative infections expected (130,033-315,269); with data available until the 31st of March the peak should be reached on May 4 (April 25 to May 18) with 202,210 cumulative infections expected (155.235-270,737); with data available until the 07st of April the peak should be reached on May 3 (April 26 to May 11) with 191,586 (160,861-232,023) cumulative infections expected. Based on the average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), cumulated infections forecasts provided by the EDM applied to WR performed better across all scenarios than the Gompertz model. An exponential decay model applied to the cumulated and weighted average daily growth rate appears to be useful in estimating the number of cases and peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy and the model was more reliable in the exponential growth phase.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

It is proven that the explicit solution of the model requires the introduction of a new transcendental special function, which is a solution of a non-elementary integral equation. The paper introduces iterative algorithms approximating the incidence variable, which allows for estimation of the model parameters from the numbers of observed cases.

Due to the poverty rate in Africa, as well as poor access to quality health care, inadequate medical staff and poor technology, Africa has been predicted to be one of the most severely affected continents in the world by COVID-19. The objective of this study was to examine the survival rate of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) forecasting approach. The source of the data used for this study was the secondary data obtained from the daily publication/report of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) from 28th February 2020 to 30th June 2020. The mean daily survival rate of COVID-19 patients was found to be 27.5% with a median survival rate of 25.4% which is below 50%. Also, the ARIMA (0, 1, 1) was identified to be appropriate for predicting the survival rate of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria within the observed period. Further findings showed that little variation exists between the predicted and actual survival rate of COVID19 for June 2020 which indicates that the obtained ARIMA model (0, 1, 1) was adequate for the estimation of the survival rate of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Based on the findings of the study, the need for the Nigerian government to explore effective treatment strategies both internationally and locally to improve the survival rate of patients with the disease was strongly recommended. Also, the need for the government to encourage local manufacturing of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as garment, which is expected to help health workers effectively manage affected persons without being infected at the front line was recommended.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Treatment

To curb the diffusion of COVID-19, the local government has responded to the outbreak by enforcing a set of restricted measures on economic and social activities across the country. Objectives: Here, we aim to assess the propagation of COVID-19 by estimating the coronavirus active cases and mortality rate in two major business hubs of Bangladesh, namely Dhaka and Chittagong city under flexible lockdown conditions. Methods: We apply a data-driven forecasting model using Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered and Deaths status through time to deal with coronavirus outbreak. Results: The epidemiological model forecasts the dire consequences for Dhaka city with 2400 death cases at the end of December, 2020, whereas Chittagong city might experience 14% more deaths than Dhaka if the severe restrictions are not implemented to control the pandemic. Conclusion: Although lockdown has a positive impact in reducing the diffusion of COVID-19, it is disastrous for human welfare and national economies. Therefore, a unidirectional decision by the policymakers might cost a very high price on either way for a lower-middle-income country, Bangladesh. In this study, we suggest a fair trade-off between public health and the economy to avoid enormous death tolls and economic havoc in Bangladesh.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

In this presented research, we have picked up the existing mathematical model of corona virus which has six ordinary differential equations involving fractional derivative with non-singular kernel and Mittag-Leffler law. Another new thing is that we study this model in a fuzzy environment. We will discuss why we need a fuzzy environment for this model.

In Europe, the situation of Italy first and later Spain has generated great concen, and despite other countries show better prospects, large uncertainties yet remain on the future evolution and the efficacy of containment, mitigation, or attack strategies. This Manuscript was originally written in the last days of March as a way to report on the first current wave of the pandemic. The results were updated several times for March and also for the month of July. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we also incorporate effects of varying proportions of containment. We fit data to reported infected populations at the beginning of the first peak of the pandemic to account for the uncertainties in case reporting and study the scenario projections for the individual regions (CCAA). The aim of this model it's to evaluate the confinement rate at the first stages of the epidemic outbreak in order to assess the scenarios that minimize the incidence but also the mortality. Results indicate that with data for March 23, the epidemics follow an evolution similar to the isolation of 1 , 5 percent of the population, and if there were no effects of intervention actions it might reach a maximum of over 1.4 M infected around April 27. The effect on the epidemics of the ongoing partial confinement measures is yet unknown (an update of results with data until March 31st is included), but increasing the isolation around ten times more could drastically reduce the peak to over 100 k cases by early April, while each day of delay in taking this hard containment scenario represents a 90 percent increase of the infected population at the peak. Dynamics at the sub aggregated levels of CCAA show epidemics at the different levels of progression with the most worrying situation in Madrid and Catalonia. Increasing alpha values up to 10 times, in addition to a drastic reduction in clinical cases, would also more than a half the number of deaths. Updates for March 31st simulations indicate a substantial reduction in burden is underway. A similar approach conducted for Italy pre-and post-intervention also begins to suggest a substantial reduction in both infected and deaths has been achieved, showing the efficacy of drastic social distancing interventions. By last we show the real evolution of the pandemic up to the end of May and the beginning of July in order to calculate the real confinement rate from data to compare with the scenarios formulated at March.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

An exhaustive statistical analysis was performed using data collected from Turkey and South Africa within the period of 11 March 2020 to 3 May 2020 and 05 March and 3 of May, respectively. It was observed that in the case of Turkey, a negative Spearman correlation for the number of infected class and a positive Spearman correlation for both the number of deaths and recoveries were obtained. This implied that the daily infections could decrease, while the daily deaths and number of recovered people could increase under current conditions. In the case of South Africa, a negative Spearman correlation for both daily deaths and daily infected people were obtained, indicating that these numbers may decrease if the current conditions are maintained. The utilization of a statistical technique predicted the daily number of infected, recovered, and dead people for each country; and three results were obtained for Turkey, namely an upper boundary, a prediction from current situation and lower boundary. The histograms of the daily number of newly infected, recovered and death showed a sign of lognormal and normal distribution, which is presented using the Bell curving method parameters estimation.

33390766,Optimal design of lock-down and reopening policies for early-stage epidemics through SIR-D models.,,"The diffusion of COVID-19 represents a real threat for the health and economic system of a country. Therefore the governments have to adopt fast containment measures in order to stop its spread and to prevent the related devastating consequences. In this paper, a technique is proposed to optimally design the lock-down and reopening policies so as to minimize an aggregate cost function accounting for the number of individuals that decease due to the spread of COVID-19. A constraint on the maximal number of concomitant infected patients is also taken into account in order to prevent the collapse of the health system. The optimal procedure is built on the basis of a simple SIR model that describes the outbreak of a generic disease, without attempting to accurately reproduce all the COVID-19 epidemic features. This modeling choice is motivated by the fact that the containing measurements are actuated during the very first period of the outbreak, when the characteristics of the new emergent disease are not known but timely containment actions are required. In fact, as a consequence of dealing with poor preliminary data, the simplest modeling choice is able to reduce unidentifiability problems. Further, the relative simplicity of this model allows to compute explicitly its solutions and to derive closed-form expressions for the maximum number of infected and for the steady-state value of deceased individuals. These expressions can be then used to design static optimization problems so to determine the (open-loop) optimal lock-down and reopening policies for early-stage epidemics accounting for both the health and economic costs.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

METHODS: Data for COVID-19 pandemic control from Thailand, representing social restriction, versus data from Sweden, representing the herd immunity plan, collected from January 13 to May 31, 2020, were analyzed by using the SIR (susceptible, infectious, recovered) model. RESULTS: The SIR model analysis demonstrated a beneficial effect of each model on the attenuation of the mortality rate, with lower mortality in social restriction and shorter overall pandemic duration in the herd immunity plan. However, the herd immunity plan demonstrated a higher mortality rate than social restriction (46.9% versus 1.9%) despite the later entry of the virus in Sweden. When the SIR model was used for predicting the COVID-19 status, Sweden was shown to likely end its COVID-19 epidemic earlier than Thailand (268 vs. 368 days). With the nonlinear estimation, at least one log difference between total confirmed cases versus active cases could be used as an indicator for relaxation of the lockdown policy in Thailand. CONCLUSIONS: Both the social restriction and herd immunity plans are beneficial for COVID-19 pandemic control in terms of the amelioration of pandemic mortality. The cumulative number of total recovered cases might be a potential parameter that could be used for determining the policy direction for COVID-19 control.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33385101,Graph modelling for tracking the COVID-19 pandemic spread.,covid-19;epidemiological characteristics;graph visualization;modelling;pandemic,"The modelling is widely used in determining the best strategies for the mitigation of the impact of infectious diseases. Currently, the modelling of a complex system such as the spread of COVID-19 infection is among the topical issues. The aim of this article is graph-based modelling of the COVID-19 infection spread. The article investigates the studies related to the modelling of COVID-19 pandemic and analyses the factors affecting the spread of the disease and its main characteristics. We propose a conceptual model of COVID-19 epidemic by considering the social distance, the duration of contact with an infected person and their location-based demographic characteristics. Based on the hypothetical scenario of the spread of the virus, a graph model of the process are developed starting from the first confirmed infection case to human-to-human transmission of the virus and visualized by considering the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. The application of graph for the pandemic modelling allows for considering multiple factors affecting the epidemiological process and conducting numerical experiments. The advantage of this approach is justified with the fact that it enables the reverse analysis the spread as a result of the dynamic record of detected cases of the infection in the model. This approach allows for to determining undetected cases of infection based on the social distance and duration of contact and eliminating the uncertainty significantly. Note that social, economic, demographic factors, the population density, mental values and etc. affect the increase in number of cases of infection and hence, the research was not able to consider all factors. In future research will analyze multiple factors impacting the number of infections and their use in the models will be considered.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

R0 is a derivative of the following variables-the duration of infectivity after the patient gets infected, the likelihood of transmission of infection per contact between a susceptible person and an infectious individual, and the contact rate. R0 is usually estimated retrospectively from serial epidemiological data or using theoretical mathematical models. Epidemiologists can calculate R0 using contact-tracing data, the most common method is to use cumulative incidence data. When mathematical models are used, R0 values are estimated using ordinary differential equations. R0 of COVID-19 as initially estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) was between 1.4 and 2.4. The forecast is of critical importance as it will help the governments to have an estimate as well as strategize quickly to avoid any unfavorable condition.

Among them, the prediction model based on mathematical epidemiology (SIR) is the most widely used, but most of these models are adapted in special situations based on various assumptions. In this study, a general adapted time-window based SIR prediction model is proposed, which is characterized by introducing a time window mechanism for dynamic data analysis and using machine learning method predicts the basic reproduction number and the exponential growth rate of the epidemic. We analyzed COVID-19 data from February to July 2020 in seven countries---China, South Korea, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Germany and France, and the numerical results showed that the framework can effectively measure the real-time changes of the parameters during the epidemic, and error rate of predicting the number of COVID-19 infections in a single day is within 5%.",Epidemic Forecasting

A susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) compartment model is considered with additional compartments of hospitalized population whose condition is severe or critical and the fatality compartment. The basic reproduction number (R 0) is computed by the next-generation matrix approach and later expressed as a time-dependent function so as to incorporate the NPIs into the model. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is solved using fourth-order and fifth-order Runge-Kutta methods. Different intervention scenarios are considered, and the results show that implementation of closure of education institutions, curfew, and partial lockdown yields predicted delayed peaks of the overall infections, severe cases, and fatalities and subsequently containment of the pandemic in the country.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Evacuation by aircraft may be an effective countermeasure against outbreaks of infectious diseases, but evidence of its effect is scarce. This study estimated how many COVID-19 cases were prevented among the Japanese residents of Wuhan by the evacuation countermeasure. METHODS: We constructed a SETAIR (susceptible-exposed-transitional-asymptomatic-infectious-recovered) model to capture the epidemic growth of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan to estimate the predicted number of COVID-19 cases among Wuhan's Japanese residents if evacuation had not occurred at the end of January. We used data on the number of COVID-19 cases confirmed in Hubei Province for the period Jan 20-Feb 16, 2020, and on the number of cases of Japanese residents who were evacuated by aircraft on Jan 29, 30, and 31. RESULTS: Eleven imported COVID-19 cases were reported on Feb 1 from among the total 566 evacuees who returned to Japan. In the case of no evacuations being made, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases among Wuhan's Japanese residents was estimated to reach 25 (95% CI [20,29]) on Feb 8 and 34 (95% CI [28,40]) on Feb 15. A 1-week delay in the evacuation might be led to 14 additional cases and a 2-week delay to 23 additional cases. CONCLUSIONS: Evacuation by aircraft can contribute substantially to reducing the number of infected cases in the initial stage of the outbreak.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33380055,A logistic model and predictions for the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.,,"The rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide presents a great challenge to epidemic modelers. Model outcomes vary widely depending on the characteristics of a pathogen and the models. Here, we present a logistic model for the epidemic spread and divide the spread of the novel coronavirus into two phases: the first phase is a natural exponential growth phase that occurs in the absence of intervention and the second phase is a regulated growth phase that is affected by enforcing social distancing and isolation. We apply the model to a number of pandemic centers. Our results are in good agreement with the data to date and show that social distancing significantly reduces the epidemic spread and flattens the curve. Predictions on the spreading trajectory including the total infections and peak time of new infections for a community of any size are made weeks ahead, providing the vital information and lead time needed to prepare for and mitigate the epidemic. The methodology presented here has immediate and far-reaching applications for ongoing outbreaks or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We show that the resulting SEIR behavior-perception model has three principal modes of qualitative behavior-no outbreak, controlled outbreak, and uncontrolled outbreak. We also demonstrate that the model can produce transient and sustained waves of infection consistent with secondary outbreaks. We fit the model to cumulative COVID-19 case and mortality data from several regions. Our analysis suggests that regions which experience a significant decline after the first wave of infection, such as Canada and Israel, are more likely to contain secondary waves of infection, whereas regions which only achieve moderate success in mitigating the disease's spread initially, such as the United States, are likely to experience substantial secondary waves or uncontrolled outbreaks.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

However, such models are based on meagre data and limited biological understanding. We evaluate the accuracy of various models from recent pandemics (SARS, MERS and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak) as a guide to whether we can trust the early model predictions for COVID-19. We show that early models can have good predictive power for a disease's first wave, but they are less predictive of the possibility of a second wave or its strength. The models with the highest accuracy tended to include stochasticity, and models developed for a particular geographic region are often applicable in other regions. It follows that mathematical models developed early in a pandemic can be useful for long-term predictions, at least during the first wave, and they should include stochastic variations, to represent unknown characteristics inherent in the earliest stages of all pandemics.",Epidemic Forecasting

In the current work, a new proposed SEIR model as a mathematical model for the outbreak of novel coronaviruses COVID-19 will be constructed. The new proposed SEIR pandemic model provides a new vision for evaluations and management of the epidemic of COVID-19 infection. For mathematical modeling and dynamic analyses, this paper uses the real data of spreading COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. The dynamics of the proposed SEIR model are presented with the reproduction number and the extensive stability analysis. We discussed the domain of the solution and equilibrium situation based on the proposed SEIR model by using Jacobian's method of linearization. The condition of equilibrium and its uniqueness has been proved, and the stability analysis of disease-free equilibrium has been introduced. A sensitivity analysis of the reproduction number against its internal parameters has been done. The global stability of the equilibrium of this model has been proved by using Lyapunov's Stability theorem. A numerical verification and predictions of the proposed SEIR model have been made with comparing the results based on the SEIR model and the real data due to the spreading of the COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. The proposed SEIR model is a successful model to analyze the spreading of epidemics like COVID-19.

The model is validated by matching the model with the data on cases of COVID-19 resurgence in April of 2020 from Heilongjiang province in China, which indicates that the predictive values from the mathematical model fit the real data very well. Based upon the computations from the model and analytical formulae, we reveal how the indirect transmission from environmental pathogens contribute to the disease outbreak and how the input of asymptomatic individuals affect the disease spread.

COVID-19 has put an unexpected and inordinate degree of pressure on healthcare systems of strong and fragile countries alike. To launch both containment and mitigation measures, each country requires estimates of COVID-19 incidence as such preparedness allows agencies to plan efficient resource allocation and to design control strategies. Here, we have developed a new adaptive, interacting, and cluster-based mathematical model to predict the granular trajectory of COVID-19. We have analyzed incidence data from three currently afflicted countries of Italy, the United States of America, and India. We show that our approach predicts state-wise COVID-19 spread for each country with reasonable accuracy. We show that Rt, as the effective reproduction number, exhibits significant spatial variations in these countries. However, by accounting for the spatial variation of Rt in an adaptive fashion, the predictive model provides estimates of the possible asymptomatic and undetected COVID-19 cases, both of which are key contributors in COVID-19 transmission. We have applied our methodology to make detailed predictions for COVID19 incidences at the district and state level in India. Finally, to make the models available to the public at large, we have developed a web-based dashboard, namely ""Predictions and Assessment of Corona Infections and Transmission in India"" (PRACRITI, see http://pracriti.iitd.ac.in), which provides the detailed Rt values and a three-week forecast of COVID cases.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

In the early stage of the outbreak, the most important question concerns some meaningful milepost moments, including the time when the number of daily confirmed cases decreases, the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes smaller than that of the daily removed (recovered and death), and the time when the number of daily confirmed cases and patients treated in hospital, which can be called ""active cases"", becomes zero. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to make right and precise prediction due to the limited amount of available data at the early stage of the outbreak. To address it, in this paper, we propose a flexible framework incorporating the effectiveness of the government control to forecast the whole process of a new unknown infectious disease in its early-outbreak. Methods: We first establish the iconic indicators to characterize the extent of epidemic spread. Then we develop the tracking and forecasting procedure with mild and reasonable assumptions. Finally we apply it to analyze and evaluate the COVID-19 outbreak using the public available data for mainland China beyond Hubei Province from the China Centers for Disease Control (CDC) during the period of Jan 29th, 2020, to Feb 29th, 2020, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. Results: Forecasting results indicate that the number of newly confirmed cases will become zero in the mid-early March, and the number of patients treated in the hospital will become zero between mid-March and mid-April in mainland China beyond Hubei Province. Conclusions: The framework proposed in this paper can help people get a general understanding of the epidemic trends in countries where COVID-19 are raging as well as any other outbreaks of new and unknown infectious diseases in the future.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

At the same time, the dissemination of contradictory model predictions has highlighted their limitations. If some parameters and/or state variables of a model cannot be determined from output measurements, its ability to yield correct insights - as well as the possibility of controlling the system - may be compromised. Epidemic dynamics are commonly analysed using compartmental models, and many variations of such models have been used for analysing and predicting the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper we survey the different models proposed in the literature, assembling a list of 36 model structures and assessing their ability to provide reliable information. We address the problem using the control theoretic concepts of structural identifiability and observability. Since some parameters can vary during the course of an epidemic, we consider both the constant and time-varying parameter assumptions. We analyse the structural identifiability and observability of all of the models, considering all plausible choices of outputs and time-varying parameters, which leads us to analyse 255 different model versions. We classify the models according to their structural identifiability and observability under the different assumptions and discuss the implications of the results. We also illustrate with an example several alternative ways of remedying the lack of observability of a model. Our analyses provide guidelines for choosing the most informative model for each purpose, taking into account the available knowledge and measurements.",Epidemic Forecasting

METHODS: Only confirmed COVID-19 cases who are Vietnamese and locally infected with available data on date of symptom onset and clearly defined window of possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure were included. We used three parametric forms with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method for Bayesian Inference to estimate incubation period for Vietnamese COVID-19 cases. Leave-one-out Information Criterion was used to assess the performance of three models. RESULTS: A total of 19 cases identified from 23 Jan 2020 to 13 April 2020 was included in our analysis. Average incubation periods estimated using different distribution model ranged from 6.0 days to 6.4 days with the Weibull distribution demonstrated the best fit to the data. The estimated mean of incubation period using Weibull distribution model was 6.4 days (95% credible interval (CrI): 4.89-8.5), standard deviation (SD) was 3.05 (95%CrI 3.05-5.30), median was 5.6, ranges from 1.35 to 13.04 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentiles). Extreme estimation of incubation periods is within 14 days from possible infection. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides evidence for an average incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 6.4 days.

METHODS: A Bayesian SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) epidemiological model was used to rebuild the local transmission dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in nine regions of England. RESULTS: The basic reproduction number (R0) in England was found to be relatively high compared with China. The estimate of the temporally varying effective reproduction number (Rt) suggests that the control measures, especially the forced lockdown, were effective to reduce transmissibility and curb the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the overall incidence rate in the UK has declined, forecasting highlights the possibility of a second epidemic wave in several regions.

33353964,New statistical RI index allow to better track the dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy.,,"COVID-19 pandemic in Italy displayed a spatial distribution that made the tracking of its time course quite difficult. The most relevant anomaly was the marked spatial heterogeneity of COVID-19 diffusion. Lombardia region accounted for around 60% of fatal cases (while hosting 15% of Italian population). Moreover, 86% of fatalities concentrated in four Northern Italy regions. The 'explosive' outbreak of COVID-19 in Lombardia at the very beginning of pandemic fatally biased the R-like statistics routinely used to control the disease dynamics. To (at least partially) overcome this bias, we propose a new index RI = dH/dI (daily derivative ratio of H and I, given H = Healed and I = Infected), corresponding to the ratio between healed and infected patients relative daily changes. The proposed index is less flawed than R by the uncertainty related to the estimated number of infected persons and allows to follow (and possibly forecast) epidemic dynamics in a largely model-independent way. To analyze the dynamics of the epidemic, starting from the beginning of the virus spreading-when data are insufficient to make an estimate by adopting SIR model-a ""sigmoidal family with delay"" logistic model was introduced. That approach allowed in estimating the epidemic peak using the few data gathered even before mid-March. Based on this analysis, the peak was correctly predicted to occur by end of April. Analytical methodology of the dynamics of the epidemic we are proposing herein aims to forecast the time and intensity of the epidemic peak (forward prediction), while allowing identifying the (more likely) beginning of the epidemic (backward prediction). In addition, we established a relationship between hospitalization in intensive care units (ICU) versus deaths daily rates by avoiding the necessity to rely on precise estimates of the infected fraction of the population The joint evolution of the above parameters over time allows for a trustworthy and unbiased estimation of the dynamics of the epidemic, allowing us to clearly detect the qualitatively different character of the 'so-called' second wave with respect to the previous epidemic peak.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In terms of confirmed deaths per million inhabitants, as of October 22, Ecuador ranks fourth in the Americas and ninth worldwide according to data from the World Health Organization. In this report, we estimate excess deaths due to any cause in Ecuador since the start of the lockdown measures on March 17, 2020 until October 22, 2020. METHODS: Estimates of excess deaths were calculated as the difference between the number of observed deaths from all causes and estimates of expected deaths from all causes. Expected deaths were estimated for the period March 17-October 22, 2020 from forecasts of an ARIMA model of order (3,0,1) with drift which was applied to daily mortality data for the period from January 1, 2014 to March 16, 2020. RESULTS: The number of all-cause excess deaths in Ecuador was estimated to be 36,922 (95% bootstrap confidence interval: 32,314-42,696) during the study period. The peak in all-cause excess mortality in Ecuador may have occurred on April 4, 2020, with 909 excess deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the real impact of the pandemic in Ecuador was much worse than that indicated by reports from national institutions. Estimates of excess mortality might provide a better approximation of the true COVID-19 death toll.

The actual number of infections potentially exceeds the number of confirmed cases. DEVELOPMENT: We develop a demographic scaling model to estimate COVID-19 infections, based on minimal data requirements: COVID-19-related deaths, infection fatality rates (IFRs), and life tables. As many countries lack IFR estimates, we scale them from a reference country based on remaining lifetime to better match the context in a target population with respect to age structure, health conditions and medical services. We introduce formulas to account for bias in input data and provide a heuristic to assess whether local seroprevalence estimates are representative for the total population. APPLICATION: Across 10 countries with most reported COVID-19 deaths as of 23 July 2020, the number of infections is estimated to be three [95% prediction interval: 2-8] times the number of confirmed cases. Cross-country variation is high. The estimated number of infections is 5.3 million for the USA, 1.8 million for the UK, 1.4 million for France, and 0.4 million for Peru, or more than one, six, seven and more than one times the number of confirmed cases, respectively. Our central prevalence estimates for entire countries are markedly lower than most others based on local seroprevalence studies. CONCLUSIONS: The national infection estimates indicate that the pandemic is far more widespread than the numbers of confirmed cases suggest. Some local seroprevalence estimates largely deviate from their corresponding national mean and are unlikely to be representative for the total population.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Eight countries: Italy, New Zealand, the USA, Brazil, India, Pakistan, Spain, and South Africa which are in different phases of COVID-19 distribution as well as in different socioeconomic and geographical characteristics were selected as test cases. The Alpha-Sutte Indicator approach was utilized as the modelling strategy. The capability of the approach in modelling COVID-19 cases over the ARIMA method was tested in the study. Data consist of accumulated COVID-19 cases present in the selected countries from the first day of the presence of cases to September 26, 2020. Ten percent of the data were used to validate the modelling approach. The analysis disclosed that the Alpha-Sutte modelling approach is appropriate in modelling cumulative COVID-19 cases over ARIMA by reporting 0.11%, 0.33%, 0.08%, 0.72%, 0.12%, 0.03%, 1.28%, and 0.08% of the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the USA, Brazil, Italy, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Spain, and South Africa, respectively. Differences between forecasted and real cases of COVID-19 in the validation set were tested using the paired t-test. The differences were not statistically significant, revealing the effectiveness of the modelling approach. Thus, predictions were generated using the Alpha-Sutte approach for each country. Therefore, the Alpha-Sutte method can be recommended for short-term forecasting of cumulative COVID-19 incidences. The authorities in the health care sector and other administrators may use the predictions to control and manage the COVID-19 cases.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The tracing of confirmed cases and the prediction of the local dynamics of contagion through early indicators are crucial measures to a successful fight against emerging infectious diseases (EID). The proposed framework is model-free and applies Early Warning Detection Systems (EWDS) techniques to detect changes in the territorial spread of infections in the very early stages of onset. This study uses publicly available raw data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 mainly sourced from the database of the Italian Civil Protection Department. Two distinct EWDS approaches, the Hub-Jones (H&J) and Strozzi-Zaldivar (S&Z), are adapted and applied to the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. They promptly generate warning signals and detect the onset of an epidemic at early surveillance stages even if working on the limited daily available, open-source data. Additionally, EWDS S&Z criterion is theoretically validated on the basis of the epidemiological SIR. Discussed EWDS successfully analyze self-accelerating systems, like the SARS-CoV-2 scenario, to precociously identify an epidemic spread through the calculation of onset parameters. This approach can also facilitate early clustering detection, further supporting common fight strategies against the spread of EIDs. Overall, we are presenting an effective tool based on solid scientific and methodological foundations to be used to complement medical actions to contrast the spread of infections such as COVID-19.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33342517,Range of reproduction number estimates for COVID-19 spread.,covid-19;generation time;renewal equation;reproduction number;seir-based model,"To monitor local and global COVID-19 outbreaks, and to plan containment measures, accessible and comprehensible decision-making tools need to be based on the growth rates of new confirmed infections, hospitalization or case fatality rates. Growth rates of new cases form the empirical basis for estimates of a variety of reproduction numbers, dimensionless numbers whose value, when larger than unity, describes surging infections and generally worsening epidemiological conditions. Typically, these determinations rely on noisy or incomplete data gained over limited periods of time, and on many parameters to estimate. This paper examines how estimates from data and models of time-evolving reproduction numbers of national COVID-19 infection spread change by using different techniques and assumptions. Given the importance acquired by reproduction numbers as diagnostic tools, assessing their range of possible variations obtainable from the same epidemiological data is relevant. We compute control reproduction numbers from Swiss and Italian COVID-19 time series adopting both data convolution (renewal equation) and a SEIR-type model. Within these two paradigms we run a comparative analysis of the possible inferences obtained through approximations of the distributions typically used to describe serial intervals, generation, latency and incubation times, and the delays between onset of symptoms and notification. Our results suggest that estimates of reproduction numbers under these different assumptions may show significant temporal differences, while the actual variability range of computed values is rather small.",Epidemic Forecasting

STUDY DESIGN: Data for all COVID-19 cases were collected until 20 October 2020 in Punjab Province. METHODS: The methodology included geotagging COVID-19 cases to understand the trans-mobility areas for COVID-19 and characterize risk. The hotspot analysis technique was used to identify the number of areas in danger zones and the number of people affected by COVID-19. The complete lockdown areas were marked down geographically to be selected by the government of Pakistan based on increased numbers of cases. RESULTS: As per predictive model estimates, almost 9.2 million people are COVID-19 infected by 20 October 2020 in Punjab Province. The compound growth rate of COVID-19 decreased to 0.012% per day and doubling rate increased to 364.5 days in Punjab Province. Based on Pueyo model predictions from past temporal data, it is more likely that Punjab and Pakistan entered into peak around the first week of July 2020, and the decline of growth rate (and doubling rate) of reported cases started afterward. Hospital load was also measured through the Pueyo model, and mostly, people in the 60+ years age group are expected to dominate the hospitalized population. CONCLUSIONS: Pakistan is experiencing a high number of COVID-19 cases, with the maximum share from Punjab, Pakistan. Statistical modeling and compound growth estimation formulation were done through the Pueyo model, which was applied in Pakistan to identify the compound growth of COVID-19 patients and predicting numbers of patients shortly by slightly modifying it as per the local context.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission
33338320,Response to COVID-19 in Cyprus: Policy changes and epidemic trends.,,"OBJECTIVES: In late July, Cyprus experienced the second epidemic wave of COVID-19. We present the steps taken by the government and evaluate their effect on epidemic trends. MATERIALS: Cyprus Press and Information Office data were analysed. Using an R-based forecasting program, two models were created to predict cases up to 01/09/2020: Model 1, which utilised data up to 09/06/2020, when airports reopened to foreign travelers with COVID-19 screening; and Model 2, which utilised data until 24/06/2020, when screening for passengers from low-transmission countries was discontinued. RESULTS: PIO data revealed no significant policy changes between 24/06/2020 and 31/07/2020. Prediction models were robust and accurate (Model 1, R(2) = 0.999, P < .001; Model 2, R(2) = 0.998, P < .001). By August 30th, recorded cases exceeded those predicted by Model 1 by 24.47% and by Model 2 by 20.95%, with P values <.001 for both cases. CONCLUSIONS: The significant difference between recorded cases and those projected by Models 1 and 2 suggests that changes in epidemic trends may have been associated with policy changes after their respective dates. Discontinuation of major restrictions such as airport reopening, can destabilise the control of the epidemic, and may concomitantly necessitate a reevaluation of the current epidemic status. In the face of an evolving situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic, states are forced to balance the imposing of restrictions against their impact on the economy.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

According to the publicly reported data, the first case of novel corona virus in Pakistan was reported on 27th February 2020. The aim of the present study is to describe the mathematical model and dynamics of COVID-19 in Pakistan. To investigate the spread of coronavirus in Pakistan, we develop the SEIR time fractional model with newly, developed fractional operator of Atangana-Baleanu. We present briefly the analysis of the given model and discuss its applications using world health organization (WHO) reported data for Pakistan. We consider the available infection cases from 19th March 2020, till 31st March 2020 and accordingly, various parameters are fitted or estimated. It is worth noting that we have calculated the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] which shows that virus is spreading rapidly. Furthermore, stability analysis of the model at disease free equilibrium DFE and endemic equilibriums EE is performed to observe the dynamics and transmission of the model. Finally, the AB fractional model is solved numerically. To show the effect of the various embedded parameters like fractional parameter [Formula: see text] on the model, various graphs are plotted. It is worth noting that the base of our investigation, we have predicted the spread of disease for next 200 days.",Epidemic Forecasting

Additionally, the basic reproduction number (R0) and number of infectors and patients who left Hubei were estimated using the coordinate descent algorithm. The median R0 at the initial stage of the epidemic was 4.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.82-5.17). Before the traffic lockdown was implemented in Hubei, 2000 (95% CI 1982-2030) infectors and patients had left Hubei and traveled throughout the country. The model estimated that if the government had taken prevention and control measures 1 day later, the cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed patients in the whole country would have increased by 32.1%. If the lockdown of Hubei was imposed 1 day in advance, the cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed patients in other provinces would have decreased by 7.7%. The stochastic model could fit the officially issued data well and simulate the evolution process of the epidemic.

33332363,Real-time neural network based predictor for cov19 virus spread.,,"Since the epidemic outbreak in early months of 2020 the spread of COVID-19 has grown rapidly in most countries and regions across the World. Because of that, SARS-CoV-2 was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020, by The World Health Organization (WHO). That's why many scientists are working on new methods to reduce further growth of new cases and, by intelligent patients allocation, reduce number of patients per doctor, what can lead to more successful treatments. However to properly manage the COVID-19 spread there is a need for real-time prediction models which can reliably support various decisions both at national and international level. The problem in developing such system is the lack of general knowledge how the virus spreads and what would be the number of cases each day. Therefore prediction model must be able to conclude the situation from past data in the way that results will show a future trend and will possibly closely relate to the real numbers. In our opinion Artificial Intelligence gives a possibility to do it. In this article we present a model which can work as a part of an online system as a real-time predictor to help in estimation of COVID-19 spread. This prediction model is developed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to estimate the future situation by the use of geo-location and numerical data from past 2 weeks. The results of our model are confirmed by comparing them with real data and, during our research the model was correctly predicting the trend and very closely matching the numbers of new cases in each day.",Epidemic Forecasting

To describe the idea about the factors influencing the outbreak data, we presented the current situation of the COVID-19 outbreak with graphical trends. Methods: Primary data were collected and analyzed by using a pre-created Google Survey form having a pre-set questionnaire on the social distancing status of different districts. Secondary data on the total and the daily number of laboratory tests, confirmed positive cases, and death cases were extracted from the publicly available sources to make predictions. We estimated the basic reproduction number (R ) based on the SIR mathematical model and predicted the probable fate of this pandemic in Bangladesh. Results: Quarantine situations in different regions of Bangladesh were evaluated and presented. We also provided tentative forecasts until 31 May 2020 and found that the predicted curve followed the actual curve approximately. Estimated R -values (6.924) indicated that infection rate would be greater than the recovery rate. Furthermore, by calibrating the parameters of the SIR model to fit the reported data, we assume the ultimate ending of the pandemic in Bangladesh by December 2022. Conclusion: We hope that the results of our analysis could contribute to the elucidation of critical aspects of this outbreak and help the concerned authority toward decision making.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Evidence From ARMA and Vector Autoregression Models.,arma model;covid-19;icu-beds;italy;spain;forecast;vector-autorregression,"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) has spread successfully worldwide in a matter of weeks. After the example of China, all the affected countries are taking hard-confinement measures to control the infection and to gain some time to reduce the significant amount of cases that arrive at the hospital. Although the measures in China reduced the percentages of new cases, this is not seen in other countries that have taken similar measures, such as Italy and Spain. After the first weeks, the worry was whether or not the healthcare system would collapse rather than its response to the patient's needs who are infected and require hospitalization. Using China as a mirror of what could happen in our countries and with the data available, we calculated a model that forecasts the peak of the curve of infection, hospitalization, and ICU bed numbers. We aimed to review the patterns of spread of the virus in the two countries and their regions, looking for similarities that reflect the existence of a typical path in this expansive virulence and the effects of the intervention of the authorities with drastic isolation measures, to contain the outbreak. A model based on Autorregressive and moving average models (ARMA) methodology and including Chinese disease pattern as a proxy, predicts the contagious pattern robustly. Based on the prediction, the hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) requirements were also calculated. Results suggest a reduction in the speed of contagion during April in both countries, earlier in Spain than in Italy. The forecast advanced a significant increase in the ICU needs for Spain surpassing 8,000 units by the end of April, but for Italy, ICU needs would decrease in the same period, according to the model. We present the following predictions to inform political leaders because they have the responsibility to maintain the national health systems away from collapsing. We are confident these data could help them into decision-taking and place the capitals (from hospital beds to human resources) into the right place.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The stability theory is used to discuss the local as well as the global properties of the proposed model.

33327169,Epidemic plateau in critical susceptible-infected-removed dynamics with nontrivial initial conditions.,,"Containment measures implemented by some countries to suppress the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in a slowdown of the epidemic characterized by time series of daily infections plateauing over extended periods of time. We prove that such a dynamical pattern is compatible with critical susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) dynamics. In traditional analyses of the critical SIR model, the critical dynamical regime is started from a single infected node. The application of containment measures to an ongoing epidemic, however, has the effect to make the system enter in its critical regime with a number of infected individuals potentially large. We describe how such nontrivial starting conditions affect the critical behavior of the SIR model. We perform a theoretical and large-scale numerical investigation of the model. We show that the expected outbreak size is an increasing function of the initial number of infected individuals, while the expected duration of the outbreak is a nonmonotonic function of the initial number of infected individuals. Also, we precisely characterize the magnitude of the fluctuations associated with the size and duration of the outbreak in critical SIR dynamics with nontrivial initial conditions. Far from herd immunity, fluctuations are much larger than average values, thus indicating that predictions of plateauing time series may be particularly challenging.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33327002,Optimal allocation of limited test resources for the quantification of COVID-19 infections.,,"The systematic identification of infected individuals is critical for the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, the spread of the disease is mostly quantified by the reported numbers of infections, hospitalisations, recoveries and deaths; these quantities inform epidemiology models that provide forecasts for the spread of the epidemic and guide policy making. The veracity of these forecasts depends on the discrepancy between the numbers of reported, and unreported yet infectious, individuals. We combine Bayesian experimental design with an epidemiology model and propose a methodology for the optimal allocation of limited testing resources in space and time, which maximises the information gain for such unreported infections. The proposed approach is applicable at the onset and spread of the epidemic and can forewarn of a possible recurrence of the disease after relaxation of interventions. We examine its application in Switzerland; the open source software is, however, readily adaptable to countries around the world. We find that following the proposed methodology can lead to vastly less uncertain predictions for the spread of the disease, thus improving estimates of the effective reproduction number and the future number of unreported infections. This information can provide timely and systematic guidance for the effective identification of infectious individuals and for decision-making regarding lockdown measures and the distribution of vaccines.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Designing optimal community responses (social distancing, vaccination) is dependent on the stage of the disease progression, discovery of asymptomatic individuals, changes in virulence of the pathogen, and current levels of herd immunity. Community strategies may have severe and undesirable social and economic side effects. Modeling is the only available scientific approach to develop effective strategies that can minimize these unwanted side effects while retaining the effectiveness of the interventions. METHODS: We extended the agent-based model, SpatioTemporal Human Activity Model (STHAM), for simulating SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. RESULTS: Here we present preliminary STHAM simulation results that reproduce the overall trends observed in the Wasatch Front (Utah, United States of America) for the general population. The results presented here clearly indicate that human activity patterns are important in predicting the rate of infection for different demographic groups in the population.

Many countries have pointed out that electricity supply security during the epidemic is critical to ensuring people's livelihood. Accurate prediction of electricity demand would act a more important role in ensuring energy security for all the countries. Although there have been many studies on electricity forecasting, they did not consider the pandemic, and many works only considered the prediction accuracy and ignored the stability. Driven by the above reasons, it is necessary to develop an electricity consumption prediction model that can be well applied in the pandemic. In this work, a hybrid prediction system is proposed with data processing, modelling, and optimization. An improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise is used for data preprocessing, which overcomes the shortcomings of the original method; a multi-objective optimizer is adopted for ensuring the accuracy and stability; support vector machine is used as the prediction model. Taking daily electricity demand of US as an example, the results prove that the proposed hybrid models are superior to benchmark models in both prediction accuracy and stability.

However, from the epidemiological point of view, the dimension of the problem is still unknown, since the number of actual cases of SARS-CoV-2 infected people is underestimated, due to limited testing. This paper aims at estimating the actual Infection Fatality Ratio (number of deaths with respect to the number of infected people) and the actual current prevalence (number of infected people with respect to the entire population), both in a specific population and all over the world. With this aim, this paper proposes a method to estimate Infection Fatality Ratio of a still ongoing infection, based on a daily estimation, and on the relationship between this estimation and the number of tests performed per death. The method has been applied using data about COVID-19 from Italy. Results show a fatality ratio of about 0.9%, which is lower than previous findings. The number of actual infected people in Italy is also estimated, and results show that (i) infection started at the end of January 2020; (ii) a maximum number of about 100,000 new cases in one day was reached at the beginning of March 2020; (iii) the estimated cumulative number of infections at the beginning of October 2020 is about 4.2 million cases in Italy (more than 120 million worldwide, if a generalization is conjectured as reasonable). Therefore, the prevalence at the beginning of October 2020 is estimated at about 6.9% in Italy (1.6% worldwide, if a generalization is conjectured).",Epidemic Forecasting

To assess its prevalence, it is necessary to have adequate models that allow real-time modeling of the impact of various quarantine measures by the state. The SIR model, which is implemented using a multi-agent system based on mobile cellular automata, was improved. The paper suggests ways to improve the rules of the interaction and behavior of agents. Methods of comparing the parameters of the SIR model with real geographical, social and medical indicators have been developed. That allows the modeling of the spatial distribution of COVID-19 as a single location and as the whole country consisting of individual regions that interact with each other by transport, taking into account factors such as public transport, supermarkets, schools, universities, gyms, churches, parks. The developed model also allows us to assess the impact of quarantine, restrictions on transport connections between regions, to take into account such factors as the incubation period, the mask regime, maintaining a safe distance between people, and so on. A number of experiments were conducted in the work, which made it possible to assess both the impact of individual measures to stop the pandemic and their comprehensive application.

MEASUREMENTS: Age-specific excess deaths in the United States from 1 March to 31 August 2020 compared with 2015 to 2019 were estimated, after changes in population size and age were taken into account, by using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provisional death data and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. Cause-specific excess deaths were estimated by month and age. RESULTS: From March through August 2020, 1 671 400 deaths were registered in the United States, including 173 300 COVID-19 deaths. An average of 1 370 000 deaths were reported over the same months during 2015 to 2019, for a crude excess of 301 400 deaths (128 100 non-COVID-19 deaths). However, the 2020 U.S. population includes 5.04 million more persons aged 65 years and older than the average population in 2015 to 2019 (a 10% increase). After population changes were taken into account, an estimated 217 900 excess deaths occurred from March through August 2020 (173 300 COVID-19 and 44 600 non-COVID-19 deaths). Most excess non-COVID-19 deaths occurred in April, July, and August, and 34 900 (78%) were in persons aged 25 to 64 years. Diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and heart disease caused the most non-COVID-19 excess deaths. LIMITATION: Provisional death data are underestimated because of reporting delays. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an estimated 218 000 excess deaths in the United States between March and August 2020, and 80% of those deaths had COVID-19 as the underlying cause. Accounting for population changes substantially reduced the excess non-COVID-19 death estimates, providing important information for guiding future clinical and public health interventions.

33315980,Estimation of the basic reproduction number (0) of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran.,basic reproduction number;covid-19;iran;transmissibility,"Background: Estimation of the basic reproduction number of an infectious disease is an important issue for controlling the infection. Here, we aimed to estimate the basic reproduction number (0) of COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: To estimate 0 in Iran and Tehran, the capital, we used 3 different methods: exponential growth rate, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian time-dependent. Daily number of confirmed cases and serial intervals with a mean of 4.27 days and a standard deviation of 3.44 days with gamma distribution were used. Sensitivity analysis was performed to show the importance of generation time in estimating 0. Results: The epidemic was in its exponential growth 11 days after the beginning of the epidemic (Feb 19, 2020) with doubling time of 1.74 (CI: 1.58-1.93) days in Iran and 1.83 (CI: 1.39-2.71) in Tehran. Nationwide, the value of 0 from February 19 to 29 using exponential growth method, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian time-dependent methods was 4.70 (95% CI: 4.23-5.23), 3.90 (95% CI: 3.47- 4.36), and 3.23 (95% CI: 2.94-3.51), respectively. In addition, in Tehran, 0 was 5.14 (95% CI: 4.15-6.37), 4.20 (95% CI: 3.38-5.14), and 3.94 (95% CI: 3.45-4.40) for exponential growth, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian time-dependent methods, respectively. Bayesian time dependent methods usually provide less biased estimates. The results of sensitivity analyses demonstrated that changes in the mean generation time affect estimates of 0. Conclusion: The estimate of 0 for the COVID-19 ranged from 3.94 to 5.14 in Tehran and from 3.23 to 4.70 in nationwide using different methods, which were significantly larger than 1, indicating the potential of COVID-19 to cause an outbreak.",Epidemic Forecasting
33312514,Estimation of unreported SARS-CoV-2 cases in Italy using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Dead model.,,"Background: An important epidemiological characteristic that might modulate the pandemic potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the proportion of undocumented cases. Methods: Here, we employed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) model to estimate the proportion of unreported SARS-CoV-2 cases in Italy from the reported number of deaths prior to the adoption of national control measures. Results: We estimated 115 894 infectious individuals (95% confidence interval (CI) = 95 318-140 455) and a total of 144 116 cases (95% CI = 119 030-173 959) on 20 March, 2020. These estimates resulted in 67.3% (95% CI = 60.3%-73.0%) unreported infectious individuals and in 67.4% (95% CI = 60.5%-73.0%) total cases. As such, given the substantial volume of undocumented cases, the case fatality risk would drop from an apparent 8.6% to an estimated 2.6% (95% CI = 2.2%-2.9%). Conclusions: Our findings partially explain the case fatality risk observed in Italy with a high proportion of unreported SARS-CoV-2 cases. Moreover, we underline that the fraction of undocumented infectious individuals is a critical epidemiological characteristic that needs to be taken into for a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.",Epidemic Forecasting

The aim of this study is to examine the potential advantages of Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for forecasting the number of daily confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries caused by COVID-19, which are the three main variables of interest. This paper contributes to the literature on forecasting COVID-19 pandemic in several ways. Firstly, an algorithm is proposed to calculate the optimal parameters of SSA including window length and the number of leading components. Secondly, the results of two forecasting approaches in the SSA, namely vector and recurrent forecasting, are compared to those from other commonly used time series forecasting techniques. These include Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Fractional ARIMA (ARFIMA), Exponential Smoothing, TBATS, and Neural Network Autoregression (NNAR). Thirdly, the best forecasting model is chosen based on the accuracy measure Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and it is applied to forecast 40 days ahead. These forecasts can help us to predict the future behaviour of this disease and make better decisions. The dataset of Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University is adopted to forecast the number of daily confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for top ten affected countries until October 29, 2020. The findings of this investigation show that no single model can provide the best model for any of the countries and forecasting horizons considered here. However, the SSA technique is found to be viable option for forecasting the number of daily confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries caused by COVID-19 based on the number of times that it outperforms the competing models.",Epidemic Forecasting
33311822,COVID-19: Forecasting confirmed cases and deaths with a simple time-series model.,covid-19;decision making;exponential smoothing;pandemic;time-series forecasting;uncertainty,"Forecasting the outcome of outbreaks as early and as accurately as possible is crucial for decision making and policy implementations. A significant challenge faced by forecasters is that not all outbreaks and epidemics turn into pandemics making the prediction of their severity difficult. At the same time, the decisions made to enforce lockdowns and other mitigating interventions versus their socioeconomic consequences are not only hard to make, but also highly uncertain. The majority of modeling approaches to outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics take an epidemiological approach that considers biological and disease processes. In this paper, we accept the limitations of forecasting to predict the long-term trajectory of an outbreak, and instead, we propose a statistical, time-series approach to modelling and predicting the short-term behaviour of COVID-19. Our model assumes a multiplicative trend, aiming to capture the continuation of the two variables we predict (global confirmed cases and deaths) as well as their uncertainty. We present the timeline of producing and evaluating 10-day-ahead forecasts over a period of four months. Our simple model offers competitive forecast accuracy and estimates of uncertainty that are useful and practically relevant.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33304643,A modified SEIR model applied to the data of COVID-19 spread in Saudi Arabia.,,"The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model is an established and appropriate approach in many countries to ascertain the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. We wished to create a new COVID-19 model to be suitable for patients in any country. In this work, a modified SEIR model was constructed. We used the real data of COVID-19 spread in Saudi Arabia for statistical analyses and complex analyses. The reproduction number and detailed review of stability demonstrated the complexities of our proposed SEIR model. The solution and equilibrium condition were explored based on Jacobian's linearization approach to the proposed SEIR model. The state of equilibrium was demonstrated, and a stability study was conducted in the disease-free environment. The reproduction number was measured sensitively against its internal parameters. Using the Lyapunov principle of equilibrium, the overall consistency of balance of our model was demonstrated. Findings using the SEIR model and observed outcomes due to COVID-19 spread in Saudi Arabia were compared. The modified SEIR model could enable successful analyses of the spread of epidemics such as COVID-19. An ""ideal protocol"" comprised essential steps to help Saudi Arabia decelerate COVID-19 spread. The most important aspects are to stay at home as much as possible and for infected people to remain in an isolated zone or secure area.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33304642,Pandemic infection rates are deterministic but cannot be modeled.,,"The covid-19 infection rates for a large number of infections collected from a large number of different sites are well defined with a negligible scatter. The simplest invertible iterated map, exponential growth and decay, emerges from country-wide histograms whenever Tchebychev's inequality is satisfied to within several decimal places. This is one point. Another is that failed covid-19 pandemic model predictions have been reported repeatedly by the news media. Model predictions fail because the observed infection rates are beyond modeling: any model that uses fixed rates or uses memory or averages of past rates cannot reproduce the data on active infections. When those possibilities are ruled out, then little is left. Under lockdown and social distancing, the rates unfold daily in small but unforeseeable steps, they are algorithmically complex. We can, however, use two days in the daily data, today and any single day in the past (generally yesterday), to make a useful forecast of future infections. No model provides results better than this simple forecast. We analyze the actual doubling times for covid-19 data and compare them with our predicted doubling times. Flattening and peaking are precisely defined. We identify and study the separate effects of social distancing vs recoveries in the daily infection rates. Social distancing can only cause flattening but recoveries are required in order for the active infections to peak and decay. Three models and their predictions are analyzed. Pandemic data for Austria, Germany, Italy, the USA, the UK, Finland, China, Taiwan, and Sweden are discussed.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33303925,Tracking the early depleting transmission dynamics of COVID-19 with a time-varying SIR model.,,"The susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model offers the simplest framework to study transmission dynamics of COVID-19, however, it does not factor in its early depleting trend observed during a lockdown. We modified the SIR model to specifically simulate the early depleting transmission dynamics of COVID-19 to better predict its temporal trend in Malaysia. The classical SIR model was fitted to observed total (I total), active (I) and removed (R) cases of COVID-19 before lockdown to estimate the basic reproduction number. Next, the model was modified with a partial time-varying force of infection, given by a proportionally depleting transmission coefficient, [Formula: see text] and a fractional term, z. The modified SIR model was then fitted to observed data over 6 weeks during the lockdown. Model fitting and projection were validated using the mean absolute percent error (MAPE). The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 was interrupted immediately by the lockdown. The modified SIR model projected the depleting temporal trends with lowest MAPE for I total, followed by I, I daily and R. During lockdown, the dynamics of COVID-19 depleted at a rate of 4.7% each day with a decreased capacity of 40%. For 7-day and 14-day projections, the modified SIR model accurately predicted I total, I and R. The depleting transmission dynamics for COVID-19 during lockdown can be accurately captured by time-varying SIR model. Projection generated based on observed data is useful for future planning and control of COVID-19.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission
33303815,Studying the effect of lockdown using epidemiological modelling of COVID-19 and a quantum computational approach using the Ising spin interaction.,,"COVID-19 is a respiratory tract infection that can range from being mild to fatal. In India, the countrywide lockdown has been imposed since 24th march 2020, and has got multiple extensions with different guidelines for each phase. Among various models of epidemiology, we use the SIR(D) model to analyze the extent to which this multi-phased lockdown has been active in 'flattening the curve' and lower the threat. Analyzing the effect of lockdown on the infection may provide a better insight into the evolution of epidemic while implementing the quarantine procedures as well as improving the healthcare facilities. For accurate modelling, incorporating various parameters along with sophisticated computational facilities are required. Parallel to SIRD modelling, we tend to compare it with the Ising model and derive a quantum circuit that incorporates the rate of infection and rate of recovery, etc as its parameters. The probabilistic plots obtained from the circuit qualitatively resemble the shape of the curve for the spread of Coronavirus. We also demonstrate how the curve flattens when the lockdown is imposed. This kind of quantum computational approach can be useful in reducing space and time complexities of a huge amount of information related to the epidemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33303516,Modelling interventions to control COVID-19 outbreaks in a refugee camp.,control strategies;epidemiology;other study design;public health;respiratory infections,"BACKGROUND: In the absence of effective treatments or vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions are the mainstay of control in the COVID-19 pandemic. Refugee populations in displacement camps live under adverse conditions that are likely to favour the spread of disease. To date, only a few cases of COVID-19 have appeared in refugee camps, and whether feasible non-pharmaceutical interventions can prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in such settings remains untested. METHODS: We constructed the first spatially explicit agent-based model of a COVID-19 outbreak in a refugee camp, and applied it to evaluate feasible non-pharmaceutical interventions. We parameterised the model using published data on the transmission rates and progression dynamics of COVID-19, and demographic and spatial data from Europe's largest refugee camp, the Moria displacement camp on Lesbos, Greece. We simulated COVID-19 epidemics with and without four feasible interventions. RESULTS: Spatial subdivision of the camp ('sectoring') was able to 'flatten the curve', reducing peak infection by up to 70% and delaying peak infection by up to several months. The use of face masks coupled with the efficient isolation of infected individuals reduced the overall incidence of infection, and sometimes averted epidemics altogether. These interventions must be implemented quickly in order to be maximally effective. Lockdowns had only small effects on COVID-19 dynamics. CONCLUSIONS: Agent-based models are powerful tools for forecasting the spread of disease in spatially structured and heterogeneous populations. Our findings suggest that feasible interventions can slow the spread of COVID-19 in a refugee camp setting, and provide an evidence base for camp managers planning intervention strategies. Our model can be modified to study other closed populations at risk from COVID-19 or future epidemics.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33302071,Natural and human environment interactively drive spread pattern of COVID-19: A city-level modeling study in China.,covid-19;city-level;environment impact;gwr model;interactive effect;two-stage,"A novel Coronavirus COVID-19 has caused high morbidity and mortality in China and worldwide. A few studies have explored the impact of climate change or human activity on the disease incidence in China or a city. The integrated study concerning environment impact on the emerging disease is rarely reported. Therefore, based on the two-stage modeling study, we investigate the effect of both natural and human environment on COVID-19 incidence at a city level. Besides, the interactive effect of different factors on COVID-19 incidence is analyzed using Geodetector; the impact of effective factors and interaction terms on COVID-19 is simulated with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models. The results find that mean temperature (MeanT), destination proportion in population flow from Wuhan (WH), migration scale (MS), and WH*MeanT, are generally promoting for COVID-19 incidence before Wuhan's shutdown (T1); the WH and MeanT play a determinant role in the disease spread in T1. The effect of environment on COVID-19 incidence after Wuhan's shutdown (T2) includes more factors (including mean DEM, relative humidity, precipitation (Pre), travel intensity within a city (TC), and their interactive terms) than T1, and their effect shows distinct spatial heterogeneity. Interestingly, the dividing line of positive-negative effect of MeanT and Pre on COVID-19 incidence is 8.5 degrees C and 1 mm, respectively. In T2, WH has weak impact, but the MS has the strongest effect. The COVID-19 incidence in T2 without quarantine is also modeled using the developed GWR model, and the modeled incidence shows an obvious increase for 75.6% cities compared with reported incidence in T2 especially for some mega cities. This evidences national quarantine and traffic control take determinant role in controlling the disease spread. The study indicates that both natural environment and human factors integratedly affect the spread pattern of COVID-19 in China.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33301722,Effect of internationally imported cases on internal spread of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study.,,"BACKGROUND: Countries have restricted international arrivals to delay the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These measures carry a high economic and social cost, and might have little effect on COVID-19 epidemics if there are many more cases resulting from local transmission compared with imported cases. Our study aims to investigate the extent to which imported cases contribute to local transmission under different epidemic conditions. METHODS: To inform decisions about international travel restrictions, we calculated the ratio of expected COVID-19 cases from international travel (assuming no travel restrictions) to expected cases arising from internal spread, expressed as a proportion, on an average day in May and September, 2020, in each country. COVID-19 prevalence and incidence were estimated using a modelling framework that adjusts reported cases for under-ascertainment and asymptomatic infections. We considered different travel scenarios for May and September, 2020: an upper bound with estimated travel volumes at the same levels as May and September, 2019, and a lower bound with estimated travel volumes adjusted downwards according to expected reductions in May and September, 2020. Results were interpreted in the context of local epidemic growth rates. FINDINGS: In May, 2020, imported cases are likely to have accounted for a high proportion of total incidence in many countries, contributing more than 10% of total incidence in 102 (95% credible interval 63-129) of 136 countries when assuming no reduction in travel volumes (ie, with 2019 travel volumes) and in 74 countries (33-114) when assuming estimated 2020 travel volumes. Imported cases in September, 2020, would have accounted for no more than 10% of total incidence in 106 (50-140) of 162 countries and less than 1% in 21 countries (4-71) when assuming no reductions in travel volumes. With estimated 2020 travel volumes, imported cases in September, 2020, accounted for no more than 10% of total incidence in 125 countries (65-162) and less than 1% in 44 countries (8-97). Of these 44 countries, 22 (2-61) had epidemic growth rates far from the tipping point of exponential growth, making them the least likely to benefit from travel restrictions. INTERPRETATION: Countries can expect travellers infected with SARS-CoV-2 to arrive in the absence of travel restrictions. Although such restrictions probably contribute to epidemic control in many countries, in others, imported cases are likely to contribute little to local COVID-19 epidemics. Stringent travel restrictions might have little impact on epidemic dynamics except in countries with low COVID-19 incidence and large numbers of arrivals from other countries, or where epidemics are close to tipping points for exponential growth. Countries should consider local COVID-19 incidence, local epidemic growth, and travel volumes before implementing such restrictions.

33301457,"Practical considerations for measuring the effective reproductive number, Rt.",,"Estimation of the effective reproductive number Rt is important for detecting changes in disease transmission over time. During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, policy makers and public health officials are using Rt to assess the effectiveness of interventions and to inform policy. However, estimation of Rt from available data presents several challenges, with critical implications for the interpretation of the course of the pandemic. The purpose of this document is to summarize these challenges, illustrate them with examples from synthetic data, and, where possible, make recommendations. For near real-time estimation of Rt, we recommend the approach of Cori and colleagues, which uses data from before time t and empirical estimates of the distribution of time between infections. Methods that require data from after time t, such as Wallinga and Teunis, are conceptually and methodologically less suited for near real-time estimation, but may be appropriate for retrospective analyses of how individuals infected at different time points contributed to the spread. We advise caution when using methods derived from the approach of Bettencourt and Ribeiro, as the resulting Rt estimates may be biased if the underlying structural assumptions are not met. Two key challenges common to all approaches are accurate specification of the generation interval and reconstruction of the time series of new infections from observations occurring long after the moment of transmission. Naive approaches for dealing with observation delays, such as subtracting delays sampled from a distribution, can introduce bias. We provide suggestions for how to mitigate this and other technical challenges and highlight open problems in Rt estimation.",Epidemic Forecasting
33299466,Assessment of Three Mathematical Prediction Models for Forecasting the COVID-19 Outbreak in Iran and Turkey.,,"COVID-19 pandemic has become a concern of every nation, and it is crucial to apply an estimation model with a favorably-high accuracy to provide an accurate perspective of the situation. In this study, three explicit mathematical prediction models were applied to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran and Turkey. These models include a recursive-based method, Boltzmann Function-based model and Beesham's prediction model. These models were exploited to analyze the confirmed and death cases of the first 106 and 87 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran and Turkey, respectively. This application indicates that the three models fail to predict the first 10 to 20 days of data, depending on the prediction model. On the other hand, the results obtained for the rest of the data demonstrate that the three prediction models achieve high values for the determination coefficient, whereas they yielded to different average absolute relative errors. Based on the comparison, the recursive-based model performs the best, while it estimated the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran better than that of in Turkey. Impacts of applying or relaxing control measurements like curfew in Turkey and reopening the low-risk businesses in Iran were investigated through the recursive-based model. Finally, the results demonstrate the merit of the recursive-based model in analyzing various scenarios, which may provide suitable information for health politicians and public health decision-makers.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33298986,Prediction of the COVID-19 outbreak in China based on a new stochastic dynamic model.,,"The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global crisis due to its quick and wide spread over the world. A good understanding of the dynamic of the disease would greatly enhance the control and prevention of COVID19. However, to the best of our knowledge, the unique features of the outbreak have limited the applications of all existing dynamic models. In this paper, a novel stochastic model was proposed aiming to account for the unique transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and capture the effects of intervention measures implemented in Mainland China. We found that: (1) instead of aberration, there was a remarkable amount of asymptomatic virus carriers, (2) a virus carrier with symptoms was approximately twice more likely to pass the disease to others than that of an asymptomatic virus carrier, (3) the transmission rate reduced significantly since the implementation of control measures in Mainland China, and (4) it was expected that the epidemic outbreak would be contained by early March in the selected provinces and cities in China.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission
33296580,Interpretation of the Basic and Effective Reproduction Number.,infectious disease;public health;reproduction number;surveillance,"In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number (R0) is a term that describes the expected number of infections generated by 1 case in a susceptible population.

However, this metric is often misused or misinterpreted. Moreover, the complexity of the process of estimating R0 has caused difficulties for a substantial number of researchers. In this article, in order to increase the accessibility of this concept, we address several misconceptions related to the threshold characteristics of R0 and the effective reproduction number (Rt). Moreover, the appropriate interpretation of the metrics is discussed. R0 should be considered as a population-averaged value that pools the contact structure according to a stochastic transmission process. Furthermore, it is necessary to understand the unavoidable time lag for Rt due to the incubation period of the disease.",Epidemic Forecasting

A newer strain is made to emerge in the population when a preexisting strain has reached equilbrium. We assume that this newer strain does not exhibit cross-immunity with the original strain, hence those who are vaccinated and recovered from the original strain become susceptible to the newer strain. Recent events involving the COVID-19 virus shows that it is possible for a viral strain to emerge from a population at a time when the influenza virus, a well-known virus with a vaccine readily available, is active in a population. We solved for four different equilibrium points and investigated the conditions for existence and local stability. The reproduction number was also determined for the epidemiological model and found to be consistent with the local stability condition for the disease-free equilibrium.",Epidemic Forecasting

Collaboration between researchers, public health workers, and politicians has been established to deal with the epidemic. One important contribution from researchers in epidemiology is the analysis of trends so that both the current state and short-term future trends can be carefully evaluated. Gompertz model has been shown to correctly describe the dynamics of cumulative confirmed cases, since it is characterized by a decrease in growth rate showing the effect of control measures. Thus, it provides a way to systematically quantify the Covid-19 spreading velocity and it allows short-term predictions and longer-term estimations. This model has been employed to fit the cumulative cases of Covid-19 from several European countries. Results show that there are systematic differences in spreading velocity among countries. The model predictions provide a reliable picture of the short-term evolution in countries that are in the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak, and may permit researchers to uncover some characteristics of the long-term evolution. These predictions can also be generalized to calculate short-term hospital and intensive care units (ICU) requirements.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The correlation is more significant after considering incubation and symptomatic phases of this disease as experienced by people who died from it. We extend the analysis to each individual NYC borough.

It has posed a significant challenge for the global economies, especially the healthcare sector. Even with a robust healthcare system, countries were not prepared for the ramifications of COVID-19. Several statistical, dynamic, and mathematical models of the COVID-19 outbreak including the SEIR model have been developed to analyze the infection its transmission dynamics. The objective of this research is to use public data to study the properties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic to develop a dynamic hybrid model based on SEIRD and ascertainment rate with automatically selected parameters. The proposed model consists of two parts: the modified SEIRD dynamic model and ARIMA models. We fit SEIRD model parameters against historical values of infected, recovered and deceased population divided by ascertainment rate, which, in turn, is also a parameter of the model. Residuals of the first model for infected, recovered, and deceased populations are then corrected using ARIMA models. The model can analyze the input data in real-time and provide long- and short-term forecasts with confidence intervals. The model was tested and validated on the US COVID statistics dataset from the COVID Tracking Project. For validation, we use unseen recent statistical data. We use five common measures to estimate model prediction ability: MAE, MSE, MLSE, Normalized MAE, and Normalized MSE. We proved a great model ability to make accurate predictions of infected, recovered, and deceased patients.

In this paper, four phenomenological epidemic models as well as Suspected-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model are investigated for predicting the cumulative number of infected cases in Saudi Arabia in addition to the probable end-date of the outbreak. The prediction problem is formulated as an optimization framework and solved using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The Generalized Richards Model (GRM) has been found to be the best one in achieving two objectives: first, fitting the collected data (covering 223 days between March 2(nd) and October 10, 2020) with the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE = 3.2889%), the highest coefficient of determination (R(2) = 0.9953) and the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE = 8827); and second, predicting a probable end date found to be around the end of December 2020 with a projected number of 378,299 at the end of the outbreak.

In this study, we aim to propose fourteen prediction models based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the COVID-19 outbreak for policy makers. METHODS: The ANN-based models were utilized to estimate the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, Japan, Singapore, Iran, Italy, South Africa and United States of America. These models exploit historical records of confirmed cases, while their main difference is the number of days that they assume to have impact on the estimation process. The COVID-19 data were divided into a train part and a test part. The former was used to train the ANN models, while the latter was utilized to compare the purposes. The data analysis shows not only significant fluctuations in the daily confirmed cases but also different ranges of total confirmed cases observed in the time interval considered. RESULTS: Based on the obtained results, the ANN-based model that takes into account the previous 14 days outperforms the other ones. This comparison reveals the importance of considering the maximum incubation period in predicting the COVID-19 outbreak. Comparing the ranges of determination coefficients indicates that the estimated results for Italy are the best one. Moreover, the predicted results for Iran achieved the ranges of [0.09, 0.15] and [0.21, 0.36] for the mean absolute relative errors and normalized root mean square errors, respectively, which were the best ranges obtained for these criteria among different countries. CONCLUSION: Based on the achieved results, the ANN-based model that takes into account the previous fourteen days for prediction is suggested to predict daily confirmed cases, particularly in countries that have experienced the first peak of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study has not only proved the applicability of ANN-based model for prediction of the COVID-19 outbreak, but also showed that considering incubation period of SARS-COV-2 in prediction models may generate more accurate estimations.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Although neither air temperature nor humidity can be independently correlated with virus viability, a strong relationship between SARS-CoV-2 virulence and the specific enthalpy of moist air appears to exist, as confirmed by extensive data analysis. Given this framework, the present study involves a detailed investigation based on the first 20-30 days of the epidemic before public health interventions in 30 selected Italian provinces with rather different climates, here assumed as being representative of what happened in the country from North to South, of the relationship between COVID-19 distributions and the climatic conditions recorded at each site before the pandemic outbreak. Accordingly, a correlating equation between the incidence rate at the early stage of the epidemic and the foregoing average specific enthalpy of atmospheric air was developed, and an enthalpy-based seasonal virulence risk scale was proposed to predict the potential danger of COVID-19 outbreak due to the persistence of weather conditions favorable to SARS-CoV-2 viability. As an early detection tool, an unambiguous risk chart expressed in terms of coupled temperatures and relative humidity (RH) values was provided, showing that safer conditions occur in the case of higher RHs at the highest temperatures, and of lower RHs at the lowest temperatures. Despite the complex determinism and dynamics of the pandemic and the related caveats, the restriction of the study to its early stage allowed the proposed risk scale to result in agreement with the available infectivity data highlighted in the literature for a number of cities around the world.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33289877,Sequential Data Assimilation of the Stochastic SEIR Epidemic Model for Regional COVID-19 Dynamics.,covid-19;ensemble kalman filter;sequential data assimilation;stochastic epidemic model,"Newly emerging pandemics like COVID-19 call for predictive models to implement precisely tuned responses to limit their deep impact on society. Standard epidemic models provide a theoretically well-founded dynamical description of disease incidence. For COVID-19 with infectiousness peaking before and at symptom onset, the SEIR model explains the hidden build-up of exposed individuals which creates challenges for containment strategies. However, spatial heterogeneity raises questions about the adequacy of modeling epidemic outbreaks on the level of a whole country. Here, we show that by applying sequential data assimilation to the stochastic SEIR epidemic model, we can capture the dynamic behavior of outbreaks on a regional level. Regional modeling, with relatively low numbers of infected and demographic noise, accounts for both spatial heterogeneity and stochasticity. Based on adapted models, short-term predictions can be achieved. Thus, with the help of these sequential data assimilation methods, more realistic epidemic models are within reach.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

By mid-July 2020, reported cases exceeded 13 million worldwide, with at least 575,000 deaths and 7.33 million people recovered. In Oman, over 61,200 confirmed cases have been reported with an infection rate of 1.3. Spatial modeling of disease transmission is important to guide the response to the epidemic at the subnational level. Sociodemographic and healthcare factors such as age structure, population density, long-term illness, hospital beds and nurse practitioners can be used to explain and predict the spatial transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, this research aimed to examine whether the relationships between the incidence rates and these covariates vary spatially across Oman. Global Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), spatial lag and spatial error regression models (SLM, SEM), as well as two distinct local regression models (Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and multiscale geographically weighted regression MGWR), were applied to explore the spatially non-stationary relationships. As the relationships between these covariates and COVID-19 incidence rates vary geographically, the local models were able to express the non-stationary relationships among variables. Furthermore, among the eleven selected regressors, elderly population aged 65 and above, population density, hospital beds, and diabetes rates were found to be statistically significant determinants of COVID-19 incidence rates. In conclusion, spatial information derived from this modeling provides valuable insights regarding the spatially varying relationship of COVID-19 infection with these possible drivers to help establish preventative measures to reduce the community incidence rate.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

It is one of the greatest public health challenges in modern times, with no proven cure or vaccine. In this paper, our focus is on a fractional order approach to modeling and simulations of the novel COVID-19. We introduce a fractional type susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to gain insight into the ongoing pandemic. Our proposed model incorporates transmission rate, testing rates, and transition rate (from asymptomatic to symptomatic population groups) for a holistic study of the coronavirus disease. The impacts of these parameters on the dynamics of the solution profiles for the disease are simulated and discussed in detail. Furthermore, across all the different parameters, the effects of the fractional order derivative are also simulated and discussed in detail. Various simulations carried out enable us gain deep insights into the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19. The simulation results confirm that fractional calculus is an appropriate tool in modeling the spread of a complex infectious disease such as the novel COVID-19. In the absence of vaccine and treatment, our analysis strongly supports the significance reduction in the transmission rate as a valuable strategy to curb the spread of the virus. Our results suggest that tracing and moving testing up has an important benefit. It reduces the number of infected individuals in the general public and thereby reduces the spread of the pandemic. Once the infected individuals are identified and isolated, the interaction between susceptible and infected individuals diminishes and transmission reduces. Furthermore, aggressive testing is also highly recommended.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

The unique solvability of the presented COVID-19 model is proved.

The latter is a multiplicative version of the Kullback-Leibler distance, with values between 0 and 1. For product measures and self-similar phenomena, it does not depend on the measurement level. Hence, C is an alternative to Gini's concentration coefficient for measures with variation on different levels. Simple examples concern population density and gross domestic product. Application to time series patterns is indicated with a Markov chain. For the Covid-19 pandemic, entropy ratios indicate a homogeneous distribution of infections and the potential of local action when compared to measures for a whole region.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The model simulates three interrelated stochastic processes: epidemic spreading, availability of respiratory ventilators and changes in death statistics. We consider local and non-local modes of disease transmission. The first simulates transmission through social contacts in the vicinity of the place of residence while the second through social contacts in public places: schools, hospitals, airports, etc., where many people meet, who live in remote geographic locations. Epidemic spreading is modelled as a discrete-time stochastic process on random geometric networks. We use the Monte-Carlo method in the simulations. The following assumptions are made. The basic reproduction number is R0=2.5 and the infectious period lasts approximately ten days. Infections lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome in about one percent of cases, which are likely to lead to respiratory default and death, unless the patient receives an appropriate medical treatment. The healthcare system capacity is simulated by the availability of respiratory ventilators or intensive care beds. Some parameters of the model, like mortality rates or the number of respiratory ventilators per 100,000 inhabitants, are chosen to simulate the real values for the USA and Poland. In the simulations we compare 'do-nothing' strategy with mitigation strategies based on social distancing and reducing social mixing. We study epidemics in the pre-vacine era, where immunity is obtained only by infection. The model applies only to epidemics for which reinfections are rare and can be neglected. The results of the simulations show that strategies that slow the development of an epidemic too much in the early stages do not significantly reduce the overall number of deaths in the long term, but increase the duration of the epidemic. In particular, a hybrid strategy where lockdown is held for some time and is then completely released, is inefficient.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The current spread of Covid-19 in Brazil is problematic causing a huge public health burden to its population and national health-care service. To evaluate strategies for alleviating such problems, it is necessary to forecast the number of cases and deaths in order to aid the stakeholders in the process of making decisions against the disease. We propose a novel system for real-time forecast of the cumulative cases of Covid-19 in Brazil. Methods: We developed the novel COVID-SGIS application for the real-time surveillance, forecast and spatial visualization of Covid-19 for Brazil. This system captures routinely reported Covid-19 information from 27 federative units from the Brazil.io database. It utilizes all Covid-19 confirmed case data that have been notified through the National Notification System, from March to May 2020. Time series ARIMA models were integrated for the forecast of cumulative number of Covid-19 cases and deaths. These include 6-days forecasts as graphical outputs for each federative unit in Brazil, separately, with its corresponding 95% CI for statistical significance. In addition, a worst and best scenarios are presented. Results: The following federative units (out of 27) were flagged by our ARIMA models showing statistically significant increasing temporal patterns of Covid-19 cases during the specified day-to-day period: Bahia, Maranhao, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte, Amapa, Rondonia, where their day-to-day forecasts were within the 95% CI limits. Equally, the same findings were observed for Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais, Parana, and Santa Catarina. The overall percentage error between the forecasted values and the actual values varied between 2.56 and 6.50%. For the days when the forecasts fell outside the forecast interval, the percentage errors in relation to the worst case scenario were below 5%. Conclusion: The proposed method for dynamic forecasting may be used to guide social policies and plan direct interventions in a cost-effective, concise, and robust manner. This novel tools can play an important role for guiding the course of action against the Covid-19 pandemic for Brazil and country neighbors in South America.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In our explanation, we regard a given population (the whole world or a single nation) as composed by many sub-clusters which, after lockdown, evolve essentially independently.

Modeling of this effect is highly necessary as it will help to predict the possible impact on the overall population. The nonlinear incidence rate is the best approach to modeling this effect. At the first step, the model is formulated by using a nonlinear incidence rate with inclusion of the crowding effect, then its positivity and proposed boundedness will be addressed leading to model dynamics using the reproductive number. Then to get the graphical results a nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) scheme and fourth order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method are applied.",Epidemic Forecasting

In this study, data of COVID-19 between 20/01/2020 and 18/09/2020 for USA, Germany and the global was obtained from World Health Organization. Dataset consist of weekly confirmed cases and weekly cumulative confirmed cases for 35 weeks.

Given the negative impacts of COVID-19 on all aspects of people's lives, especially health and economy, accurately forecasting the number of cases infected with this virus can help governments to make accurate decisions on the interventions that must be taken. In this study, we propose three hybrid approaches for forecasting COVID-19 time series methods based on combining three deep learning models such as multi-head attention, long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural network (CNN) with the Bayesian optimization algorithm. All models are designed based on the multiple-output forecasting strategy, which allows the forecasting of the multiple time points. The Bayesian optimization method automatically selects the best hyperparameters for each model and enhances forecasting performance. Using the publicly available epidemical data acquired from Johns Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Center, we conducted our experiments and evaluated the proposed models against the benchmark model. The results of experiments exhibit the superiority of the deep learning models over the benchmark model both for short-term forecasting and long-horizon forecasting. In particular, the mean SMAPE of the best deep learning model is 0.25 for the short-term forecasting (10 days ahead). Also, for long-horizon forecasting, the best deep learning model obtains the mean SMAPE of 2.59.",Epidemic Forecasting

A vast majority of these studies dealt with compartmental models such as susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. Although these models are rather simple, intuitive, and insightful, we argue that they do not necessarily provide a good enough fit to the reported data, which are usually reported in the form of daily fatalities and cases during pandemics. This study proposes an alternative analytics approach that relies on diffusion models to predict the number of cases and fatalities in epidemics. After evaluating several of the well-known and widely used diffusion models in business literature, including ADBUDG, Gompertz, and Bass models, we developed and used a modified/improved version of the original Bass diffusion model to address the shortcomings of the ordinary compartmental models such as SIR and demonstrated its applicability on the portrayal of the COVID-19 pandemic incident data. The proposed model differentiates itself from other similar models by fitting the data without the need for preprocessing, requiring no initial conditions and assumptions, not involving in heavy parameterization, and also properly addressing the pressing issues such as undocumented cases, length of infectious or recovery periods.",Epidemic Forecasting

Our objective was to evaluate the impact of decreased Hib vaccination due to COVID-19 on invasive Hib disease burden in Japan. METHODS: Using a deterministic dynamic transmission model (susceptible-carriage-infection-recovery model), the incidence rates of invasive Hib disease in under 5 year olds in rapid vaccination recovery and persistent vaccination declined scenarios were compared for the next 10 years after 2020. The national Hib vaccination rate after the impact of COVID-19 reduced to 87% and 73% in 2020 from approximately 97% each in 2013-2019 for primary and booster doses. RESULTS: While the persistent decline scenarios revealed an increase in invasive Hib disease incidence to 0.50/100,000 children under 5 years old, the incidence of the rapid recovery scenario slightly increased with a consistent decline of incidence after 2021. The shorter the duration of the decline in vaccination rate was, the smaller the incremental disease burden observed in the model. Compared to the rapid recovery scenario, the permanent decline scenario showed a 296.87 cumulative incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALY) loss for the next 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: The persistent decline of Hib vaccination rate due to COVID-19 causes an incremental disease burden irrespective of the possible decline of Hib transmission rate by COVID-19 mitigation measures. A rapid recovery of vaccination coverage rate can prevent this possible incremental disease burden.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

We estimated epidemiological parameters, evaluated the effect of control measures on the epidemic in India, and explored strategies to exit lockdown. We obtained patient-level data to estimate the delay from onset to confirmation and the asymptomatic proportion. We estimated the basic and time-varying reproduction number (R0 and Rt) after adjusting for imported cases and delay to confirmation using incidence data from March 4 to April 25, 2020. Using a SEIR-QDPA model, we simulated lockdown relaxation scenarios and increased testing to evaluate lockdown exit strategies. R0 for India was estimated to be 2.08, and the Rt decreased from 1.67 on March 30 to 1.16 on April 22. We observed that the delay from the date of lockdown relaxation to the start of the second wave increases as lockdown is extended farther after the first wave peak-this delay is longer if lockdown is relaxed gradually. Aggressive measures such as lockdowns may be inherently enough to suppress an outbreak; however, other measures need to be scaled up as lockdowns are relaxed. Lower levels of social distancing when coupled with a testing ramp-up could achieve similar outbreak control as an aggressive social distancing regime where testing was not increased.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

In our work, we adapt a traditional SEIR epidemic model to the specific dynamic compartments and epidemic parameters of COVID 19, as it spreads in an age-heterogeneous community. We analyze management strategies of the epidemic course (as they were implemented through lockdown and reopening procedures in many of the US states and countries worldwide); however, to more clearly illustrate ideas, we focus on the example of a small scale college town community, with the timeline of control measures introduced in the state of New York.

They allow for computational case studies on non-pharmaceutical interventions thereby providing an important basis for policy makers. While research is ongoing on the transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, it is important to come up with epidemic models that can describe the main stages of the progression of the associated COVID-19 respiratory disease. We propose an age-stratified discrete compartment model as an alternative to differential equation based S-I-R type of models. The model captures the highly age-dependent progression of COVID-19 and is able to describe the day-by-day advancement of an infected individual in a modern health care system. The fully-identified model for Switzerland not only predicts the overall histories of the number of infected, hospitalized and deceased, but also the corresponding age-distributions. The model-based analysis of the outbreak reveals an average infection fatality ratio of 0.4% with a pronounced maximum of 9.5% for those aged >/= 80 years. The predictions for different scenarios of relaxing the soft lockdown indicate a low risk of overloading the hospitals through a second wave of infections.

Eventually, such characteristics are also observed between different regions of the same country. Herewith, we introduce a general method that allows us to compare the evolution of the pandemic in different localities inside a large territorial country: in the case of the present study, Brazil. To evaluate our method, we study the heterogeneous spreading of the COVID-19 outbreak until May 30th, 2020, in Brazil and its 27 federative units, which has been seen as the current epicenter of the pandemic in South America. Each one of the federative units may be considered a cluster of interacting people with similar habits and distributed to a highly heterogeneous demographic density over the entire country. Our first set of results regarding the time-series analysis shows that: (i) a power-law growth of the cumulative number of infected people is observed for federative units of the five regions of Brazil; and (ii) the distance correlation calculated between the time series of the most affected federative units and the curve that describes the evolution of the pandemic in Brazil remains about 1 over most of the time, while such quantity calculated for the federative units with a low incidence of newly infected people remains about 0.95. In the second set of results, we focus on the heterogeneous distribution of the confirmed cases and deaths. By applying the epidemiological susceptible-infected-recovered-dead model we estimated the effective reproduction number (ERN) [Formula: see text] during the pandemic evolution and found that: (i) the mean value of [Formula: see text] for the eight most affected federative units in Brazil is about 2; (ii) the current value of [Formula: see text] for Brazil is greater than 1, which indicates that the epidemic peak is far off; and (iii) Ceara was the only federative unit for which the current [Formula: see text]. Based on these findings, we projected the effects of increase or decrease of the ERN and concluded that if the value of [Formula: see text] increases 20%, not only the peak might grow at least 40% but also its occurrence might be anticipated, which hastens the collapse of the public health-care system. In all cases, keeping the ERN 20% below the current value can save thousands of people in the long term.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We also propose a method for forecasting case counts, which takes advantage of the common, latent information in the entire sample of curves, instead of just the history of a single country. Our framework facilitates to quantify the effects of demographic covariates and social mobility on doubling rates and case fatality rates through a time-varying regression model.

Forecasting the long-term trend of the COVID-19 epidemic can help health authorities determine the transmission characteristics of the virus and take appropriate prevention and control strategies beforehand. Previous studies that solely applied traditional epidemic models or machine learning models were subject to underfitting or overfitting problems. We propose a new model named Dynamic-Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Quarantined (D-SEIQ), by making appropriate modifications of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered (SEIR) model and integrating machine learning based parameter optimization under epidemiological rational constraints. We used the model to predict the long-term reported cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases in China from January 27, 2020. We evaluated our model on officially reported confirmed cases from three different regions in China, and the results proved the effectiveness of our model in terms of simulating and predicting the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak. In China-Excluding-Hubei area within 7 days after the first public report, our model successfully and accurately predicted the long trend up to 40 days and the exact date of the outbreak peak. The predicted cumulative number (12,506) by March 10, 2020, was only 3.8% different from the actual number (13,005). The parameters obtained by our model proved the effectiveness of prevention and intervention strategies on epidemic control in China. The prediction results for five other countries suggested the external validity of our model. The integrated approach of epidemic and machine learning models could accurately forecast the long-term trend of the COVID-19 outbreak. The model parameters also provided insights into the analysis of COVID-19 transmission and the effectiveness of interventions in China.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

These efforts have proved useful in some instances by allowing decision makers to distinguish different scenarios during the emergency, but their accuracy has been disappointing, forecasts ignore uncertainties and less attention is given to local areas. In this study, we propose a simple Multiple Linear Regression model, optimised to use phone call data to forecast the number of daily confirmed cases. Moreover, we produce a probabilistic forecast that allows decision makers to better deal with risk. Our proposed approach outperforms ARIMA, ETS, Seasonal Naive, Prophet and a regression model without call data, evaluated by three point forecast error metrics, one prediction interval and two probabilistic forecast accuracy measures. The simplicity, interpretability and reliability of the model, obtained in a careful forecasting exercise, is a meaningful contribution to decision makers at local level who acutely need to organise resources in already strained health services. We hope that this model would serve as a building block of other forecasting efforts that on the one hand would help front-line personal and decision makers at local level, and on the other would facilitate the communication with other modelling efforts being made at the national level to improve the way we tackle this pandemic and other similar future challenges.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We estimate serial interval (SI) and temporal reproduction number (Rt) of SARS-CoV-2 in Tunisia. METHODS: We collected data of investigations and contact tracing between March 1, 2020 and May 5, 2020 as well as illness onset data during the period February 29-May 5, 2020 from National Observatory of New and Emerging Diseases of Tunisia. Maximum likelihood (ML) approach is used to estimate dynamics of Rt. RESULTS: Four hundred ninety-one of infector-infectee pairs were involved, with 14.46% reported pre-symptomatic transmission. SI follows Gamma distribution with mean 5.30 days [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 4.66-5.95] and standard deviation 0.26 [95% CI 0.23-0.30]. Also, we estimated large changes in Rt in response to the combined lockdown interventions. The Rt moves from 3.18 [95% Credible Interval (CrI) 2.73-3.69] to 1.77 [95% CrI 1.49-2.08] with curfew prevention measure, and under the epidemic threshold (0.89 [95% CrI 0.84-0.94]) by national lockdown measure. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings highlight contribution of interventions to interrupt transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Tunisia.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

There is an increasing need to create a model that allows particular clinics and hospitals to estimate the number of patients that require Intensive Care Units-ICU care (critical), and the number of patients that require hospital care (severe), but not ICU care, in order to manage their limited resources. This paper presents a prediction of the total number of ICU and regular beds that will be needed in Bogota, Colombia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We use an SEIR model that includes three different categories of infection: those who can stay at home, those who need regular hospital beds, and those who need ICU treatment. The model allows for a time varying transmission rate which we use to incorporate the measures introduced by the government over the period of one semester. The model predicts that by mid November 2020, the city will need 1362 ICU beds and more than 9000 regular hospital beds. The number of active cases will be 67,866 by then and the death toll will reach 13,268 people by the end of December. We provide a Shiny app available at https://claudia-rivera-rodriguez.shinyapps.io/shinyappcovidclinic/. The original values in the app reproduce the results of this paper, but the parameters and starting values can be changed according to the user's needs. COVID-19 has posed too many challenges to health systems around the globe. This model is a useful tool for cities, hospitals and clinics in Colombia that need to be prepared for the excess demand of services that a pandemic like this one generates. Unfortunately, the model predicts that by mid-November the projected capacity of the system in Bogota will not be enough. We expect the lockdown rules to be strengthened in future days, so the death toll will not be as bad as predicted by this model.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The number of confirmed novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) was predicted based on the FUDAN-CCDC mathematical model (which was a new model namely based on the novel time delay dynamic model and the statistical data from Chinese Center for Disease Control (CCDC)). The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 were studied based on its clinical classification, and the prevention and treatment effects of antibacterial drugs on the COVID-19 were explored. Firstly, a FUDAN-CCDC mathematical model was established to predict the number of confirmed COVID-19 patients. Secondly, 500 COVID-19 patients with clear epidemiological history and confirmed by nucleic acid testing who were admitted to our Hospital from February 1, 2020 to May 1, 2020 were taken as research objects in this study. They were divided into 4 categories: mild cases, moderate cases, severe cases, and critical cases based on the standards given by the World Health Organization (WHO). The general data characteristics, epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations characteristics, laboratory indicator characteristics, and prevention and treatment effects of patients with COVID-19 were analyzed. The FUDAN-CCDC model predicted that the peak time of cumulative confirmed cases in Wuhan was from February 1 to February 5, the peak of cumulative confirmed cases was around 60,000, and the peak time of newly confirmed cases was from February 8 to February 11. Most of the patients with COVID-19 in critical cases were older, with an average age of 65.31+/-8.26years old; it was mainly imported case (94 cases, 18.8%) at the beginning, and was mainly local cases (406 cases, 81.2%) later. The initial symptoms were fever (447 cases, 89.4%) and cough (304 cases, 60.8%), and the patients in severe and critical cases were often accompanied by respiratory failure and other late symptoms. There were differences in laboratory tests, patients in critical cases had increased procalcitonin (PCT) and less lymphocytes (LYM). The treatment of COVID-19 was mainly moxifloxacin tablets or injections and cefoperazone sodium sulbactam sodium for injection, with significant efficacy, but the cure rate of patients in severe and critical cases was low, which was 83.1% and 68.4% respectively. FUDAN-CCDC could be applied for prediction of the COVID-19 trend. COVID-19 patients with different clinical classifications were different in clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and treatment options, and the cure rate of patients in severe and critical cases was low.

33262923,Mathematical modelling and optimal cost-effective control of COVID-19 transmission dynamics.,,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by a new strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains the current global health challenge. In this paper, an epidemic model based on system of ordinary differential equations is formulated by taking into account the transmission routes from symptomatic, asymptomatic and hospitalized individuals. The model is fitted to the corresponding cumulative number of hospitalized individuals (active cases) reported by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), and parameterized using the least squares method. The basic reproduction number which measures the potential spread of COVID-19 in the population is computed using the next generation operator method. Further, Lyapunov function is constructed to investigate the stability of the model around a disease-free equilibrium point. It is shown that the model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium if the basic reproduction number of the novel coronavirus transmission is less than one. Sensitivities of the model to changes in parameters are explored, and safe regions at certain threshold values of the parameters are derived. It is revealed further that the basic reproduction number can be brought to a value less than one in Nigeria, if the current effective transmission rate of the disease can be reduced by 50%. Otherwise, the number of active cases may get up to 2.5% of the total estimated population. In addition, two time-dependent control variables, namely preventive and management measures, are considered to mitigate the damaging effects of the disease using Pontryagin's maximum principle. The most cost-effective control measure is determined through cost-effectiveness analysis.

The unavailability of vaccines, delays in diagnosis of the disease, and lack of proper treatment resources are the leading causes of the rapid spread of COVID-19. The world is now facing a rapid loss of human lives and socioeconomic status. As a mathematical model can provide some real pictures of the disease spread, enabling better prevention measures. In this study, we propose and analyze a mathematical model to describe the COVID-19 pandemic. We have derived the threshold parameter basic reproduction number, and a detailed sensitivity analysis of this most crucial threshold parameter has been performed to determine the most sensitive indices. Finally, the model is applied to describe COVID-19 scenarios in India, the second-largest populated country in the world, and some of its vulnerable states.

These measures have proven to be effective in significantly reducing the prevalence of the virus. To date, no effective treatment or vaccine is available. In the effort of preserving both public health and the economical and social textures, France and Italy governments have partially released lockdown measures. Here, we extrapolate the long-term behavior of the epidemic in both countries using a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model, where parameters are stochastically perturbed with a lognormal distribution to handle the uncertainty in the estimates of COVID-19 prevalence and to simulate the presence of super-spreaders. Our results suggest that uncertainties in both parameters and initial conditions rapidly propagate in the model and can result in different outcomes of the epidemic leading or not to a second wave of infections. Furthermore, the presence of super-spreaders adds instability to the dynamics, making the control of the epidemic more difficult. Using actual knowledge, asymptotic estimates of COVID-19 prevalence can fluctuate of the order of 10x10(6) units in both countries.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33261327,Mathematical modeling of COVID-19: Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in India.,,"In the absence of effective vaccine/antiviral strategies for reducing the burden of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in India, the main focus has been on basic non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as nationwide lockdown (travel restrictions and the closure of schools, shopping malls, and worshipping and other gathering places), quarantining of exposed individuals, and isolation of infected individuals. In the present study, we propose a compartmental epidemic model incorporating quarantine and isolation compartments to (i) describe the current transmission patterns of COVID-19 in India, (ii) assess the impact of currently implemented NPIs, and (iii) predict the future course of the pandemic with various scenarios of NPIs in India. For R0<1, the system has a globally asymptotically stable disease free equilibrium, while for R0>1, the system has one unstable disease free equilibrium and a unique locally stable endemic equilibrium. By using the method of least squares and the best fit curve, we estimate the model parameters to calibrate the model with daily new confirmed cases and cumulative confirmed cases in India for the period from May 1, 2020 to June 25, 2020. Our result shows that the implementation of an almost perfect isolation in India and 33.33% increment in contact-tracing on June 26, 2020 may reduce the number of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in India by around 53.8% at the end of July 2020.

Although Tokyo, Japan, is no exception to this, it was initially affected by only a small-level epidemic. Nevertheless, medical collapse nearly happened since no predictive methods were available to assess infection counts. A standard susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) epidemiological model has been widely used, but its applicability is limited often to the early phase of an epidemic in the case of a large collective population. A full numerical simulation of the entire period from beginning until end would be helpful for understanding COVID-19 trends in (separate) counts of inpatient and infectious cases and can also aid the preparation of hospital beds and development of quarantine strategies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop an epidemiological model that considers the isolation period to simulate a comprehensive trend of the initial epidemic in Tokyo that yields separate counts of inpatient and infectious cases. It was also intended to induce important corollaries of governing equations (ie, effective reproductive number) and equations for the final count. METHODS: Time-series data related to SARS-CoV-2 from February 28 to May 23, 2020, from Tokyo and antibody testing conducted by the Japanese government were adopted for this study. A novel epidemiological model based on a discrete delay differential equation (apparent time-lag model [ATLM]) was introduced. The model can predict trends in inpatient and infectious cases in the field. Various data such as daily new confirmed cases, cumulative infections, inpatients, and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test positivity ratios were used to verify the model. This approach also derived an alternative formulation equivalent to the standard SIR model. RESULTS: In a typical parameter setting, the present ATLM provided 20% less infectious cases in the field compared to the standard SIR model prediction owing to isolation. The basic reproductive number was inferred as 2.30 under the condition that the time lag T from infection to detection and isolation is 14 days. Based on this, an adequate vaccine ratio to avoid an outbreak was evaluated for 57% of the population. We assessed the date (May 23) that the government declared a rescission of the state of emergency. Taking into consideration the number of infectious cases in the field, a date of 1 week later (May 30) would have been most effective. Furthermore, simulation results with a shorter time lag of T=7 and a larger transmission rate of alpha=1.43alpha0 suggest that infections at large should reduce by half and inpatient numbers should be similar to those of the first wave of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: A novel mathematical model was proposed and examined using SARS-CoV-2 data for Tokyo. The simulation agreed with data from the beginning of the pandemic. Shortening the period from infection to hospitalization is effective against outbreaks without rigorous public health interventions and control.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

This is especially important in real-time surveillance, where the aim is to gain situational awareness, for example, if cases are currently increasing or decreasing. Reporting delays between disease onset and case reporting hamper our ability to understand the dynamics of an epidemic close to now when looking at the number of daily reported cases only. Nowcasting can be used to adjust daily case counts for occurred-but-not-yet-reported events. Here, we present a novel application of nowcasting to data on the current COVID-19 pandemic in Bavaria. It is based on a hierarchical Bayesian model that considers changes in the reporting delay distribution over time and associated with the weekday of reporting. Furthermore, we present a way to estimate the effective time-varying case reproduction number R e ( t ) based on predictions of the nowcast. The approaches are based on previously published work, that we considerably extended and adapted to the current task of nowcasting COVID-19 cases. We provide methodological details of the developed approach, illustrate results based on data of the current pandemic, and evaluate the model based on synthetic and retrospective data on COVID-19 in Bavaria.

33257790,Fractional SIR epidemiological models.,,"The purpose of this work is to make a case for epidemiological models with fractional exponent in the contribution of sub-populations to the incidence rate. More specifically, we question the standard assumption in the literature on epidemiological models, where the incidence rate dictating propagation of infections is taken to be proportional to the product between the infected and susceptible sub-populations; a model that relies on strong mixing between the two groups and widespread contact between members of the groups. We contend, that contact between infected and susceptible individuals, especially during the early phases of an epidemic, takes place over a (possibly diffused) boundary between the respective sub-populations. As a result, the rate of transmission depends on the product of fractional powers instead. The intuition relies on the fact that infection grows in geographically concentrated cells, in contrast to the standard product model that relies on complete mixing of the susceptible to infected sub-populations. We validate the hypothesis of fractional exponents (1) by numerical simulation for disease propagation in graphs imposing a local structure to allowed disease transmissions and (2) by fitting the model to the JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data for the period Jan-22-20 to April-30-20, for the countries of Italy, Germany, France, and Spain.",Epidemic Forecasting

At the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, optimization of quarantine regimes becomes paramount for public health, societal well-being, and global economy. However, biological factors that determine the duration of the virus incubation period remain poorly understood. RESULTS: We demonstrate a strong positive correlation between the length of the incubation period and disease severity for a wide range of human pathogenic viruses. Using a machine learning approach, we develop a predictive model that accurately estimates, solely from several virus genome features, in particular, the number of protein-coding genes and the GC content, the incubation time ranges for diverse human pathogenic RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2. The predictive approach described here can directly help in establishing the appropriate quarantine durations and thus facilitate controlling future outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: The length of the incubation period in viral diseases strongly correlates with disease severity, emphasizing the biological and epidemiological importance of the incubation period. Perhaps, surprisingly, incubation times of pathogenic RNA viruses can be accurately predicted solely from generic features of virus genomes. Elucidation of the biological underpinnings of the connections between these features and disease progression can be expected to reveal key aspects of virus pathogenesis.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In this study, the popular autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) will be used to forecast the cumulative number of confirmed, recovered cases, and the number of deaths in Pakistan from COVID-19 spanning June 25, 2020 to July 04, 2020 (10 days ahead forecast). METHODS: To meet the desire objectives, data for this study have been taken from the Ministry of National Health Service of Pakistan's website from February 27, 2020 to June 24, 2020. Two different ARIMA models will be used to obtain the next 10 days ahead point and 95% interval forecast of the cumulative confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths. Statistical software, RStudio, with ""forecast"", ""ggplot2"", ""tseries"", and ""seasonal"" packages have been used for data analysis. RESULTS: The forecasted cumulative confirmed cases, recovered, and the number of deaths up to July 04, 2020 are 231239 with a 95% prediction interval of (219648, 242832), 111616 with a prediction interval of (101063, 122168), and 5043 with a 95% prediction interval of (4791, 5295) respectively. Statistical measures i.e. root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used for model accuracy. It is evident from the analysis results that the ARIMA and seasonal ARIMA model is better than the other time series models in terms of forecasting accuracy and hence recommended to be used for forecasting epidemics like COVID-19. CONCLUSION: It is concluded from this study that the forecasting accuracy of ARIMA models in terms of RMSE, and MAE are better than the other time series models, and therefore could be considered a good forecasting tool in forecasting the spread, recoveries, and deaths from the current outbreak of COVID-19.

33253212,Study on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the effects of control measures in China.,,"OBJECTIVE: To reconstruct the transmission trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 and analyze the effects of control measures in China. METHODS: Python 3.7.1 was used to write a SEIR class to model the epidemic procedure and proportional estimation method to estimate the initial true infected number. The epidemic area in China was divided into three parts, Wuhan city, Hubei province (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) based on the different transmission pattern. A testing capacity limitation factor for medical resources was imposed to model the number of infected but not quarantined individuals. Baidu migration data were used to assess the number of infected individuals who migrated from Wuhan to other areas. RESULTS: Basic reproduction number, R0, was 3.6 before the city was lockdown on Jan 23, 2020. The actual infected number the model predicted was 4508 in Wuhan before Jan 23, 2020. By January 22 2020, it was estimated that 1764 infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei province. Effective reproductive number, R, gradually decreased from 3.6 (Wuhan), 3.4 (Hubei except Wuhan,) and 3.3 (China except Hubei) in stage 1 (from Dec 08, 2019 to Jan 22, 2020) to 0.67 (Wuhan), 0.59 (Hubei except Wuhan) and 0.63 (China except Hubei) respectively. Especially after January 23, 2020 when Wuhan City was closed, the infected number showed a turning point in Wuhan.

A typical power-law model of social interactions from network science reproduces the observation that individuals with a high number of contacts, ""hubs"" or ""superspreaders"", can become the primary conduits for transmission. Conversely, once the tail of the distribution is saturated, herd immunity sets in at a smaller overall recovered fraction than in the analogous SIR model.

Employing a modified SEIRD model, we predict the spread of COVID-19 by the symptomatic as well as asymptomatic infectious population. Considering reported infection primarily due to symptomatic, we compare the model predicted results with the available data to estimate the dynamics of the asymptomatically infected population. Our data indicate that in the absence of the asymptomatic infectious population, the number of symptomatic cases would have been much less.

The peak of the number of quarantined patients is shown to appear some time later than the time that the number of infected becomes maximum. On the basis of the expected utility theory, a theoretical framework to find out an optimum strategy in the space of lockdown measure and quarantine measure is proposed for minimizing the maximum number of infected and for controlling the outbreak of pandemic at its early stage.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33250530,Novel Spatiotemporal Feature Extraction Parallel Deep Neural Network for Forecasting Confirmed Cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019.,covid-19net;confirmed cases forecasting;parallel deep neural network,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic continues as of March 26 and spread to Europe on approximately February 24. A report from April 29 revealed 1.26 million confirmed cases and 125 928 deaths in Europe. To refer government and enterprise to arrange countermeasures. The paper proposes a novel deep neural network framework to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19Net framework combined 1D convolutional neural network, 2D convolutional neural network, and bidirectional gated recurrent units. COVID-19Net can well integrate the characteristics of time, space, and influencing factors of the COVID-19 accumulative cases. Three European countries with severe outbreaks were studied-Germany, Italy, and Spain-to extract spatiotemporal features and predict the number of confirmed cases. The prediction results acquired from COVID-19Net are compared to those obtained using a CNN, GRU, and CNN-GRU. The mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error, which is commonly used model assessment indices, were used to compare the accuracy of the models. The results verified that COVID-19Net was notably more accurate than the other models. The mean absolute percentage error generated by COVID-19Net was 1.447 for Germany, 1.801 for Italy, and 2.828 for Spain, which was considerably better than those of the other models. This indicated that the proposed framework could accurately predict the accumulated number of confirmed cases in the three countries and serve as an essential reference for devising public health strategies. And also indicated that COVID-19 has high spatiotemporal relations, it suggests us to keep a social distance and avoid unnecessary trips.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In this paper we design a recursive bifurcation model for analyzing COVID-19 virus spread in different countries. The bifurcation facilitates recursive processing of infected population through linear least-squares fitting. In addition, a nonlinear least-squares fitting procedure is utilized to predict the future values of infected populations. Numerical results on the data from two countries (South Korea and Germany) indicate the effectiveness of our approach, compared to a logistic growth model and a Richards model in the context of early forecast. The limitation of our approach and future research are also mentioned at the end of this paper.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

METHODS: We present a compartmental model for the disease where symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals move separately. We introduced healthcare burden parameters allowing to infer possible containment and suppression strategies. In addition, the model was scaled up to describe different interconnected areas, giving the possibility to trigger regionalized measures. It was specially adjusted to Mendoza-Argentina's parameters, but is easily adaptable for elsewhere. RESULTS: Overall, the simulations we carried out were notably more effective when mitigation measures were not relaxed in between the suppressive actions. Since asymptomatics or very mildly affected patients are the vast majority, we studied the impact of detecting and isolating them. The removal of asymptomatics from the infectious pool remarkably lowered the effective reproduction number, healthcare burden and overall fatality. Furthermore, different suppression triggers regarding ICU occupancy were attempted. The best scenario was found to be the combination of ICU occupancy triggers (on: 50%, off: 30%) with the detection and isolation of asymptomatic individuals. In the ideal assumption that 45% of the asymptomatics could be detected and isolated, there would be no need for complete lockdown, and Mendoza's healthcare system would not collapse. CONCLUSIONS: Our model and its analysis inform that the detection and isolation of all infected individuals, without leaving aside the asymptomatic group is the key to surpass this pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

To that end, in this paper, the role of Google query data in the predictability of COVID-19 in the United States at both national and state level is presented. As a preliminary investigation, Pearson and Kendall rank correlations are examined to explore the relationship between Google Trends data and COVID-19 data on cases and deaths. Next, a COVID-19 predictability analysis is performed, with the employed model being a quantile regression that is bias corrected via bootstrap simulation, i.e., a robust regression analysis that is the appropriate statistical approach to taking against the presence of outliers in the sample while also mitigating small sample estimation bias. The results indicate that there are statistically significant correlations between Google Trends and COVID-19 data, while the estimated models exhibit strong COVID-19 predictability. In line with previous work that has suggested that online real-time data are valuable in the monitoring and forecasting of epidemics and outbreaks, it is evident that such infodemiology approaches can assist public health policy makers in addressing the most crucial issues: flattening the curve, allocating health resources, and increasing the effectiveness and preparedness of their respective health care systems.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

A number of studies have used modeling techniques and developed dynamic models to estimate the epidemiological parameters, explore and project the trends of the COVID-19, and assess the effects of intervention or control measures. We identified 63 studies and summarized the three aspects of these studies: epidemiological parameters estimation, trend prediction, and control measure evaluation. Despite the discrepancy between the predictions and the actuals, the dynamic model has made great contributions in the above three aspects.

A simulation study revealed that the information based on geographical economy matrix and migration index could well predict the spatial spread of the epidemic. The results reveal that the accuracy rate of the prediction is over 87.10% with a rank difference of 3.1.

However, reported case counts are recognized to be less than the true number of cases because detection and reporting are incomplete and can vary by disease severity, geography, and over time. METHODS: To estimate the cumulative incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, symptomatic illnesses, and hospitalizations, we adapted a simple probabilistic multiplier model. Laboratory-confirmed case counts that were reported nationally were adjusted for sources of underdetection based on testing practices in inpatient and outpatient settings and assay sensitivity. RESULTS: We estimated that through the end of September, 1 of every 2.5 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 2.0-3.1) hospitalized infections and 1 of every 7.1 (95% UI: 5.8-9.0) nonhospitalized illnesses may have been nationally reported. Applying these multipliers to reported SARS-CoV-2 cases along with data on the prevalence of asymptomatic infection from published systematic reviews, we estimate that 2.4 million hospitalizations, 44.8 million symptomatic illnesses, and 52.9 million total infections may have occurred in the US population from 27 February-30 September 2020. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary estimates help demonstrate the societal and healthcare burdens of the COVID-19 pandemic and can help inform resource allocation and mitigation planning.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

This study aims to characterize key attributes of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology as the infection emerged in China. An age-stratified mathematical model was constructed to describe transmission dynamics and estimate age-specific differences in biological susceptibility to infection, age-assortativeness in transmission mixing, and transition in rate of infectious contacts (and reproduction number R 0) following introduction of mass interventions. The model estimated the infectious contact rate in early epidemic at 0.59 contacts/day (95% uncertainty interval-UI = 0.48-0.71). Relative to those 60-69 years, susceptibility was 0.06 in those </=19 years, 0.34 in 20-29 years, 0.57 in 30-39 years, 0.69 in 40-49 years, 0.79 in 50-59 years, 0.94 in 70-79 years, and 0.88 in >/=80 years. Assortativeness in transmission mixing by age was limited at 0.004 (95% UI = 0.002-0.008). R 0 rapidly declined from 2.1 (95% UI = 1.8-2.4) to 0.06 (95% UI = 0.05-0.07) following interventions' onset. Age appears to be a principal factor in explaining the transmission patterns in China. The biological susceptibility to infection seems limited among children but high among those >50 years.

33234640,Rapid review of available evidence on the serial interval and generation time of COVID-19.,covid-19;epidemiology;public health;virology,"The serial interval is the time between symptom onsets in an infector-infectee pair. The generation time, also known as the generation interval, is the time between infection events in an infector-infectee pair. The serial interval and the generation time are key parameters for assessing the dynamics of a disease. A number of scientific papers reported information pertaining to the serial interval and/or generation time for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Conduct a review of available evidence to advise on appropriate parameter values for serial interval and generation time in national COVID-19 transmission models for Ireland and on methodological issues relating to those parameters. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of the literature covering the period 1 January 2020 and 21 August 2020, following predefined eligibility criteria. Forty scientific papers met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. RESULTS: The mean of the serial interval ranged from 3.03 to 7.6 days, based on 38 estimates, and the median from 1.0 to 6.0 days (based on 15 estimates). Only three estimates were provided for the mean of the generation time. These ranged from 3.95 to 5.20 days. One estimate of 5.0 days was provided for the median of the generation time. DISCUSSION: Estimates of the serial interval and the generation time are very dependent on the specific factors that apply at the time that the data are collected, including the level of social contact. Consequently, the estimates may not be entirely relevant to other environments. Therefore, local estimates should be obtained as soon as possible. Careful consideration should be given to the methodology that is used. Real-time estimations of the serial interval/generation time, allowing for variations over time, may provide more accurate estimates of reproduction numbers than using conventionally fixed serial interval/generation time distributions.",Epidemic Forecasting;Transmission
33232385,Modeling and interpreting the COVID-19 intervention strategy of China: A human mobility view.,,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has proved a globally prevalent outbreak since December 2019. As a focused country to alleviate the epidemic impact, China implemented a range of public health interventions to prevent the disease from further transmission, including the pandemic lockdown in Wuhan and other cities. This paper establishes China's mobility network by a flight dataset and proposes a model without epidemiological parameters to indicate the spread risks through the network, which is termed as epidemic strength. By simply adjusting an intervention parameter, traffic volumes under different travel-restriction levels can be simulated to analyze how the containment strategy can mitigate the virus dissemination through traffic. This approach is successfully applied to a network of Chinese provinces and the epidemic strength is smoothly interpreted by flow maps. Through this node-to-node interpretation of transmission risks, both overall and detailed epidemic hazards are properly analyzed, which can provide valuable intervention advice during public health emergencies.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In this case, an integrator is used to combine the outputs of the modules, in this way achieving the goal of predicting a set of countries. At the level of the ensembles, forming a part of the modular network, these are constituted by a set of modules, which are nonlinear autoregressive neural networks that are designed to be efficient predictors under particular conditions for each country. In each ensemble, the results of the modules are combined with an aggregator to achieve a better and improved result for the ensemble.

By June 29, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the number of cases worldwide had reached 9 994 206 and resulted in more than 499 024 deaths. The earliest case of COVID-19 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was registered on March 2 in 2020. Since then, the number of infections as per the outcome of the tests increased gradually on a daily basis. The KSA has 182 493 cases, with 124 755 recoveries and 1551 deaths on June 29, 2020. There have been significant efforts to develop models that forecast the risks, parameters, and impacts of this epidemic. These models can aid in controlling and preventing the outbreak of these infections. In this regard, this article details the extent to which the infection cases, prevalence, and recovery rate of this pandemic are in the country and the predictions that can be made using the past and current data. The well-known classical SIR model was applied to predict the highest number of cases that may be realized and the flattening of the curve afterward. On the other hand, the ARIMA model was used to predict the prevalence cases. Results of the SIR model indicate that the repatriation plan reduced the estimated reproduction number. The results further affirm that the containment technique used by Saudi Arabia to curb the spread of the disease was efficient. Moreover, using the results, close interaction between people, despite the current measures remains a great risk factor to the spread of the disease. This may force the government to take even more stringent measures. By validating the performance of the applied models, ARIMA proved to be a good forecasting method from current data. The past data and the forecasted data, as per the ARIMA model provided high correlation, showing that there were minimum errors.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We provided numerical simulations to show the nature of the diseases for different classes. We derived existence of unique global solutions to the given time delay fractional differential equations (DFDEs) under a mild Lipschitz condition using properties of a weighted norm, Mittag-Leffler functions and the Banach fixed point theorem. For the graphical simulations, we used real numerical data based on a case study of Wuhan, China, to show the nature of the projected model with respect to time variable.

In contrast to a standard SIR model, we find that the incidence of COVID-19 spread is concave in the number of infectious individuals, as would be expected if people have inter-related social networks. This concave shape has a significant impact on forecasted COVID-19 cases. In particular, our model forecasts that the number of COVID-19 cases would only have an exponential growth for a brief period at the beginning of the contagion event or right after a reopening, but would quickly settle into a prolonged period of time with stable, slightly declining levels of disease spread. This pattern is consistent with observed levels of COVID-19 cases in the US, but inconsistent with standard SIR modeling. We forecast rates of new cases for COVID-19 under different social distancing norms and find that if social distancing is eliminated there will be a massive increase in the cases of COVID-19.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33228409,COVID-19 and the epistemology of epidemiological models at the dawn of AI.,,"The models used to estimate disease transmission, susceptibility and severity determine what epidemiology can (and cannot tell) us about COVID-19. These include: 'model organisms' chosen for their phylogenetic/aetiological similarities; multivariable statistical models to estimate the strength/direction of (potentially causal) relationships between variables (through 'causal inference'), and the (past/future) value of unmeasured variables (through 'classification/prediction'); and a range of modelling techniques to predict beyond the available data (through 'extrapolation'), compare different hypothetical scenarios (through 'simulation'), and estimate key features of dynamic processes (through 'projection'). Each of these models: address different questions using different techniques; involve assumptions that require careful assessment; and are vulnerable to generic and specific biases that can undermine the validity and interpretation of their findings. It is therefore necessary that the models used: can actually address the questions posed; and have been competently applied. In this regard, it is important to stress that extrapolation, simulation and projection cannot offer accurate predictions of future events when the underlying mechanisms (and the contexts involved) are poorly understood and subject to change. Given the importance of understanding such mechanisms/contexts, and the limited opportunity for experimentation during outbreaks of novel diseases, the use of multivariable statistical models to estimate the strength/direction of potentially causal relationships between two variables (and the biases incurred through their misapplication/misinterpretation) warrant particular attention. Such models must be carefully designed to address: 'selection-collider bias', 'unadjusted confounding bias' and 'inferential mediator adjustment bias' - all of which can introduce effects capable of enhancing, masking or reversing the estimated (true) causal relationship between the two variables examined.1 Selection-collider bias occurs when these two variables independently cause a third (the 'collider'), and when this collider determines/reflects the basis for selection in the analysis. It is likely to affect all incompletely representative samples, although its effects will be most pronounced wherever selection is constrained (e.g. analyses focusing on infected/hospitalised individuals). Unadjusted confounding bias disrupts the estimated (true) causal relationship between two variables when: these share one (or more) common cause(s); and when the effects of these causes have not been adjusted for in the analyses (e.g. whenever confounders are unknown/unmeasured). Inferentially similar biases can occur when: one (or more) variable(s) (or 'mediators') fall on the causal path between the two variables examined (i.e. when such mediators are caused by one of the variables and are causes of the other); and when these mediators are adjusted for in the analysis. Such adjustment is commonplace when: mediators are mistaken for confounders; prediction models are mistakenly repurposed for causal inference; or mediator adjustment is used to estimate direct and indirect causal relationships (in a mistaken attempt at 'mediation analysis'). These three biases are central to ongoing and unresolved epistemological tensions within epidemiology. All have substantive implications for our understanding of COVID-19, and the future application of artificial intelligence to 'data-driven' modelling of similar phenomena. Nonetheless, competently applied and carefully interpreted, multivariable statistical models may yet provide sufficient insight into mechanisms and contexts to permit more accurate projections of future disease outbreaks.",Epidemic Forecasting

While this assumption works at the onset of the outbreak, the infection force saturates as the outbreak progresses, even in the absence of any interventions. We use a simple agent-based model to illustrate this saturation effect. Its continuum limit leads a modified SIR model with exponential saturation. The derivation is based on first principles incorporating the spread radius and population density. We use the data for coronavirus outbreak for the period from March to June, to show that using SIR model with saturation is sufficient to capture the disease dynamics for many jurstictions, including the overall world-wide disease curve progression.

In particular, identifying high-risk population subgroups aids policymakers and health officials in combating the epidemic. This has been challenging during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic because governmental agencies typically release aggregate COVID-19 data as summary statistics of patient demographics. These data may identify disparities in COVID-19 outcomes between broad population subgroups, but do not provide comparisons between more granular population subgroups defined by combinations of multiple demographics. We introduce a method that helps to overcome the limitations of aggregated summary statistics and yields estimates of COVID-19 infection and case fatality rates - key quantities for guiding public policy related to the control and prevention of COVID-19 - for population subgroups across combinations of demographic characteristics. Our approach uses pseudo-likelihood based logistic regression to combine aggregate COVID-19 case and fatality data with population-level demographic survey data to estimate infection and case fatality rates for population subgroups across combinations of demographic characteristics. We illustrate our method on California COVID-19 data to estimate test-based infection and case fatality rates for population subgroups defined by gender, age, and race/ethnicity. Our analysis indicates that in California, males have higher test-based infection rates and test-based case fatality rates across age and race/ethnicity groups, with the gender gap widening with increasing age. Although elderly infected with COVID-19 are at an elevated risk of mortality, the test-based infection rates do not increase monotonically with age.

Also, all people are concerned about the future of this catastrophe and how the continuous outbreak can be prevented. Some countries are not successful in controlling the outbreak; therefore, the incidence is observed in several peaks. In this paper, firstly single-peak SIR models are used for historical data. Regarding the SIR model, the termination time of the outbreak should have been in early June 2020. However, several peaks invalidate the results of single-peak models. Therefore, we should present a model to support pandemics with several extrema. In this paper, we presented the generalized logistic growth model (GLM) to estimate sub-epidemic waves of the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. Therefore, the presented model simulated scenarios of two, three, and four waves in the observed incidence. In the second part of the paper, we assessed travel-related risk in inter-provincial travels in Iran. Moreover, the results of travel-related risk show that typical travel between Tehran and other sites exposed Isfahan, Gilan, Mazandaran, and West Azerbaijan in the higher risk of infection greater than 100 people per day. Therefore, controlling this movement can prevent great numbers of infection, remarkably.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Previous studies have indicated that the meteorological parameters can play a vital role in transmissibility and Mortality. In the present work, the influence of Comorbidity and meteorological parameters are investigated for Mortality caused due to COVID. For this, the most affected city by COVID-19 is considered, i.e., Mumbai, India, as a case study. It was found that Comorbidity is the most influential parameter on the Mortality of COVID-19. The Spearman correlation coefficient for meteorological parameters lies between 0.386 and 0.553, whereas for Comorbidity was found as 0.964. A regression model is developed using particle swarm optimization to predict the mortality cases for Mumbai, India. Further, the developed model is validated for the COVID-19 cases of Delhi, India, to emphasize the utility of the developed model for other cities. The measured and predicted curve shows a good fit with a mean percentage error of 0.00957% and a coefficient of determination of 0.9828. Thus, particle swarm optimization techniques demonstrate very high potential for the prediction of Mortality caused due to COVID-19. It is insisted that by providing constant health monitoring and adequate care for the comorbidity patients, the Mortality can be suppressed drastically. The present work can serve as an input to the policymakers to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic in India as well as other parts of the world.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33208858,The spatiotemporal estimation of the risk and the international transmission of COVID-19: a global perspective.,,"An ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, the spatiotemporal epidemic transmission, prediction, and risk are insufficient for COVID-19 but we urgently need relevant information globally. We have developed a novel two-stage simulation model to simulate the spatiotemporal changes in the number of cases and estimate the future worldwide risk. Simulation results show that if there is no specific medicine for it, it will form a global pandemic. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, and the United States are the most vulnerable. The relationship between each country's vulnerability and days before the first imported case occurred shows an exponential decrease. We successfully predicted the outbreak of South Korea, Japan, and Italy in the early stages of the global pandemic based on the information before February 12, 2020. The development of the epidemic is now earlier than we expected. However, the trend of spread is similar to our estimation.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

COVID-19 spreads quickly worldwide and affects more than 41.5 million persons (till 23 October 2020). It has a high hazard to the safety and health of people all over the world. COVID-19 has been declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, strict special policies and plans should be made to face this pandemic. Forecasting COVID-19 cases in hotspot regions is a critical issue, as it helps the policymakers to develop their future plans. In this paper, we propose a new short term forecasting model using an enhanced version of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). An improved marine predators algorithm (MPA), called chaotic MPA (CMPA), is applied to enhance the ANFIS and to avoid its shortcomings. More so, we compared the proposed CMPA with three artificial intelligence-based models include the original ANFIS, and two modified versions of ANFIS model using both of the original marine predators algorithm (MPA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The forecasting accuracy of the models was compared using different statistical assessment criteria. CMPA significantly outperformed all other investigated models.",Epidemic Forecasting

This study analyzes the effects of COVID-19 based on likely positive cases and fatality in India during and after the lockdown period from March 24, 2020, to May 24, 2020. METHODS: Python has been used as the main programming language for data analysis and forecasting using the Prophet model, a time series analysis model. The data set has been preprocessed by grouping together the days for total numbers of cases and deaths on few selected dates and removing missing values present in some states. RESULTS: The Prophet model performs better in terms of precision on the real data. Prediction depicts that, during the lockdown, the total cases were rising but in a controlled manner with an accuracy of 87%. After the relaxation of lockdown rules, the predictions have shown an obstreperous situation with an accuracy of 60%. CONCLUSION: The resilience could have been better if the lockdown with strict norms was continued without much relaxation. The situation after lockdown has been found to be uncertain as observed by the experimental study conducted in this work.",Epidemic Forecasting

To realize the transmission and control of corona virus in a much better way, first we study the stability of the corresponding deterministic model using next generation matrix along with basic reproduction number. After this, we study the qualitative analysis using ""fixed point theory"" approach.

Using these tools, we provide an overview of the possible scenarios for the COVID-19 pandemic in the phase of easing restrictions used to reopen the economy and society. To investigate the dynamics of this outbreak, we consider a deterministic compartmental model (SEIR model) with an additional parameter to simulate the restrictions. In general, as a consequence of easing restrictions, we obtain scenarios characterized by high spikes of infections indicating significant acceleration of the spreading disease. Finally, we show how such undesirable scenarios could be avoided by a control strategy of successive partial easing restrictions, namely, we tailor a successive sequence of the additional parameter to prevent spikes in phases of low rate of transmissibility.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

DESIGN: A retrospective, qualitative study. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We collected 382 596 records of weather data with four meteorological factors, namely, average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and air visibility, and 15 192 records of epidemic data with daily new confirmed case counts (1 587 209 confirmed cases in total) in nearly 500 areas worldwide from 20 January 2020 to 9 April 2020. Epidemic data were modelled against weather data to find a model that could best predict the future outbreak. RESULTS: Significant correlation of the daily new confirmed case count with the weather 3 to 7 days ago were found. SARS-CoV-2 is easy to spread under weather conditions of average temperature at 5 to 15 degrees C, relative humidity at 70% to 80%, wind speed at 1.5 to 4.5 m/s and air visibility less than 10 statute miles. A short-term model with these four meteorological variables was derived to predict the daily increase in COVID-19 cases; and a long-term model using temperature to predict the pandemic in the next week to month was derived. Taken China as a discovery dataset, it was well validated with worldwide data. According to this model, there are five viral transmission patterns, 'restricted', 'controlled', 'natural', 'tropical' and 'southern'. This model's prediction performance correlates with actual observations best (over 0.9 correlation coefficient) under natural spread mode of SARS-CoV-2 when there is not much human interference such as epidemic control. CONCLUSIONS: This model can be used for prediction of the future outbreak, and illustrating the effect of epidemic control for a certain area.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

The aim of the present study was to investigate the predictive accuracy of a prognostic model for forecasting the development of the cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases in countries and administrative regions worldwide until the end of May 2020. METHODS: The cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases was forecasted in 251 regions with a horizon of two weeks, one month, and two months using a hierarchical logistic model at the end of March 2020. Forecasts were compared to actual observations by using a series of evaluation metrics. RESULTS: On average, predictive accuracy was very high in nearly all regions at the two weeks forecast, high in most regions at the one month forecast, and notable in the majority of the regions at the two months forecast. Higher accuracy was associated with the availability of more data for estimation and with a more pronounced cumulative case growth from the first case to the date of estimation. In some strongly affected regions, cumulative case counts were considerably underestimated. CONCLUSIONS: With keeping its limitations in mind, the investigated model may be used for the preparation and distribution of resources during the initial phase of epidemics. Future research should primarily address the model's assumptions and its scope of applicability. In addition, establishing a relationship with known mechanisms and traditional epidemiological models of disease transmission would be desirable.",Epidemic Forecasting

According to present model, the epidemic under the most restrictive measures was observed of peak on around June 29 in Bangladesh with a peak size of 4100 infectious individuals which was closed to real size of 4014. In the same way, the model results also showed that the epidemic peaks were found on around September 16 in India, June 13 in Pakistan and on June 5 in Afghanistan with the peak sizes of 97,500, 6950 and 935, respectively those were closed to the real values. In addition, we have derived a model-implied basic reproduction number for each day of currently infected cases so that the mitigation and defeat strategies can be imposed to control the size of the epidemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Thus the prediction of the future trend of the disease in different countries can be useful for managing the outbreak. Several data driven works have been done for the prediction of COVID-19 cases and these data uses features of past data for future prediction. In this study the machine learning (ML)-guided linear regression model has been used to address the different types of COVID-19 related issues. The linear regression model has been fitted into the dataset to deal with the total number of positive cases, and the number of recoveries for different states in India such as Maharashtra, West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi and Assam. From the current analysis of COVID-19 data it has been observed that trend of per day number of infection follows linearly and then increases exponentially. This property has been incorporated into our prediction and the piecewise linear regression is the best suited model to adopt this property. The experimental results shows the superiority of the proposed scheme and to the best of our knowledge this is a new approach towards the prediction of COVID-19.",Epidemic Forecasting

The disease results in an acute respiratory infection that may result in pain and death. In Pakistan, the disease curve shows a vertical trend by almost 256K established cases of the diseases and 6035 documented death cases till August 5, 2020. Objective: The primary purpose of this study is to provide the statistical model to predict the trend of COVID-19 death cases in Pakistan. The age and gender of COVID-19 victims were represented using a descriptive study. Method: ology: Three regression models, which include Linear, logarithmic, and quadratic, were employed in this study for the modelling of COVID-19 death cases in Pakistan. These three models were compared based on R(2), Adjusted R(2), AIC, and BIC criterions. The data utilized for the modelling was obtained from the National Institute of Health of Pakistan from February 26, 2020 to August 5, 2020. Conclusion: The finding deduced after the prediction modelling is that the rate of mortality would decrease by the end of October. The total number of deaths will reach its maximum point; then, it will gradually decrease. This indicates that the curve of total deaths will continue to be flat, i.e., it will shift to be constant, which is also the upper bound of the underlying function of absolute death.",Epidemic Forecasting

To this purpose, we propose the application of a computational framework to a SEIR-type (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed) epidemiological model describing the different stages of COVID-19 infection. The model discriminates between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases and it takes into account possible intervention measures in order to reduce the probability of transmission. As case studies, we analyze not only the epidemic situation in Umbria but also in Italy, in order to capture the evolution of the pandemic at a national level. First of all, we estimate model parameters through a Bayesian calibration method, called Conditional Robust Calibration (CRC), while using the official COVID-19 data of the Italian Civil Protection. Subsequently, Conditional Robustness Analysis (CRA) on the calibrated model is carried out in order to quantify the influence of epidemiological and intervention parameters on the hospitalization rates. The proposed pipeline properly describes the COVID-19 spread during the lock-down phase. It also reveals the underestimation of new positive cases and the need of promptly isolating asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases. The results emphasize the importance of the lock-down timeliness and provide accurate predictions on the current evolution of the pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

In the absence of effective vaccine, different countries have employed various other types of non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain the spread of this disease, including quarantines and lockdowns, tracking, tracing and isolation of infected individuals, and social distancing measures. Effectiveness of these and other measures of disease containment and prevention to a large degree depends on good understanding of disease dynamics, and robust mathematical models play an important role in forecasting its future dynamics. In this paper we focus on Ukraine, one of Europe's largest countries, and develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 dynamics, using latest data on parameters characterising clinical features of disease. For improved accuracy, our model includes age-stratified disease parameters, as well as age- and location-specific contact matrices to represent contacts. We show that the model is able to provide an accurate short-term forecast for the numbers and age distribution of cases and deaths. We also simulated different lockdown scenarios, and the results suggest that reducing work contacts is more efficient at reducing the disease burden than reducing school contacts, or implementing shielding for people over 60.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study is to formulate a new and simple indicator that represents the COVID-19 spread rate by using publicly available data. METHODS: The new indicator K is a backward difference approximation of the logarithmic derivative of the cumulative number of cases with a time interval of 7 days. It is calculated as a ratio of the number of newly confirmed cases in a week to the total number of cases. RESULTS: The analysis of the current status of COVID-19 spreading over countries showed an approximate linear decrease in the time evolution of the K value. The slope of the linear decrease differed from country to country. In addition, it was steeper for East and Southeast Asian countries than for European countries. The regional difference in the slope seems to reflect both social and immunological circumstances for each country. CONCLUSIONS: The approximate linear decrease of the K value indicates that the COVID-19 spread does not grow exponentially but starts to attenuate from the early stage. The K trajectory in a wide range was successfully reproduced by a phenomenological model with the constant attenuation assumption, indicating that the total number of the infected people follows the Gompertz curve. Focusing on the change in the value of K will help to improve and refine epidemiological models of COVID-19.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Objective: To estimate the potential years of life lost (YLL) associated with the COVID-19 pandemic conditioned on primary schools being closed or remaining open. Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytical model estimated the association between school closures and reduced educational attainment and the association between reduced educational attainment and life expectancy using publicly available data sources, including data for 2020 from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Social Security Administration, and the US Census Bureau. Direct COVID-19 mortality and potential increases in mortality that might have resulted if school opening led to increased transmission of COVID-19 were also estimated. Main Outcomes and Measures: Years of life lost. Results: A total of 24.2 million children aged 5 to 11 years attended public schools that were closed during the 2020 pandemic, losing a median of 54 (interquartile range, 48-62.5) days of instruction. Missed instruction was associated with a mean loss of 0.31 (95% credible interval [CI], 0.10-0.65) years of final educational attainment for boys and 0.21 (95% CI, 0.06-0.46) years for girls. Summed across the population, an estimated 5.53 million (95% CI, 1.88-10.80) YLL may be associated with school closures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a total of 88241 US deaths from COVID-19 through the end of May 2020, with an estimated 1.50 million (95% CI, 1.23-1.85 million) YLL as a result. Had schools remained open, 1.47 million (95% credible interval, 0.45-2.59) additional YLL could have been expected as a result, based on results of studies associating school closure with decreased pandemic spread. Comparing the full distributions of estimated YLL under both ""schools open"" and ""schools closed"" conditions, the analysis observed a 98.1% probability that school opening would have been associated with a lower total YLL than school closure. Conclusions and Relevance: In this decision analytical model of years of life potentially lost under differing conditions of school closure, the analysis favored schools remaining open. Future decisions regarding school closures during the pandemic should consider the association between educational disruption and decreased expected lifespan and give greater weight to the potential outcomes of school closure on children's health.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The reproductive number of coronavirus provides an estimate of the possible extent of the transmission. This study aims to provide a summary reproductive number of coronavirus based on available global level evidence. METHODS: A total of three databases were searched on September 15, 2020: PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct. The searches were conducted using a pre-specified search strategy to record studies reported the reproductive number of coronavirus from its inception in December 2019. It includes keywords of coronavirus and its reproductive number, which were combined using the Boolean operators (AND, OR). Based on the included studies, we estimated a summary reproductive number by using the meta-analysis. We used narrative synthesis to explain the results of the studies where the reproductive number was reported, however, were not possible to include in the meta-analysis because of the lack of data (mostly due to confidence interval was not reported). RESULTS: Total of 42 studies included in this review whereas 29 of them were included in the meta-analysis. The estimated summary reproductive number was 2.87 (95% CI, 2.39-3.44). We found evidence of very high heterogeneity (99.5%) of the reproductive number reported in the included studies. Our sub-group analysis was found the significant variations of reproductive number across the country for which it was estimated, method and model that were used to estimate the reproductive number, number of case that was considered to estimate the reproductive number, and the type of reproductive number that was estimated. The highest reproductive number was reported for the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship in Japan (14.8). In the country-level, the higher reproductive number was reported for France (R, 6.32, 95% CI, 5.72-6.99) following Germany (R, 6.07, 95% CI, 5.51-6.69) and Spain (R, 3.56, 95% CI, 1.62-7.82). The higher reproductive number was reported if it was estimated by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) method and the Epidemic curve model. We also reported significant heterogeneity of the type of reproductive number- a high-value reported if it was the time-dependent reproductive number. CONCLUSION: The estimated summary reproductive number indicates an exponential increase of coronavirus infection in the coming days. Comprehensive policies and programs are important to reduce new infections as well as the associated adverse consequences including death.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Climate and seasonality influence the distributions of many diseases, and studies suggest at least some link between SARS-CoV-2 and weather. One such study, building species distribution models (SDMs), predicted SARS-CoV-2 risk may remain concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, shifting northward in summer months. Others have highlighted issues with SARS-CoV-2 SDMs, notably: the primary niche of the virus is the host it infects, climate may be a weak distributional predictor, global prevalence data have issues, and the virus is not in population equilibrium. While these issues should be considered, we believe climate's relationship with SARS-CoV-2 is still worth exploring, as it may have some impact on the distribution of cases. To further examine if there is a link to climate, we build model projections with raw SARS-CoV-2 case data and population-scaled case data in the USA. The case data were from across March 2020, before large travel restrictions and public health policies were impacting cases across the country. We show that SDMs built from population-scaled case data cannot be distinguished from control models (built from raw human population data), while SDMs built on raw case data fail to predict the known distribution of cases in the U.S. from March. The population-scaled analyses indicate that climate did not play a central role in early U.S. viral distribution and that human population density was likely the primary driver. We do find slightly more population-scaled viral cases in cooler areas. Ultimately, the temporal and geographic constraints on this study mean that we cannot rule out climate as a partial driver of the SARS-CoV-2 distribution. Climate's role on SARS-CoV-2 should continue to be cautiously examined, but at this time we should assume that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to spread anywhere in the U.S. where governmental policy does not prevent spread.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We use two variations of the SIR model and we include a parameter that comprises the effects of social distancing measures. Short and long term forecasts show that the social distancing policy imposed by the government is able to flatten the pattern of infection of the COVID-19. However, our results also show that if this policy does not last enough time, it is only able to shift the peak of infection into the future keeping the value of the peak in almost the same value. Furthermore, our long term simulations forecast the optimal date to end the policy. Finally, we show that the proportion of asymptomatic individuals affects the amplitude of the peak of symptomatic infected, suggesting that it is important to test the population.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33169811,Using a simple open-source automated machine learning algorithm to forecast COVID-19 spread: A modelling study.,covid-19;south korea;coronavirus;machine learning;pandemic,"INTRODUCTION: Machine learning algorithms have been used to develop prediction models in various infectious and non-infectious settings including interpretation of images in predicting the outcome of diseases. We demonstrate the application of one such simple automated machine learning algorithm to a dataset obtained about COVID-19 spread in South Korea to better understand the disease dynamics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from 20th January 2020 (when the first case of COVID-19 was detected in South Korea) to 4th March 2020 was accessed from Korea's centre for disease control (KCDC). A future time-series of specified length (taken as 7 days in our study) starting from 5th March 2020 to 11th March 2020 was generated and fed to the model to generate predictions with upper and lower trend bounds of 95% confidence intervals. The model was assessed for its ability to reliably forecast using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as the metric. RESULTS: As on 4th March 2020, 145,541 patients were tested for COVID-19 (in 45 days) in South Korea of which 5166 patients tested positive. The predicted values approximated well with the actual numbers. The difference between predicted and observed values ranged from 4.08% to 12.77% . On average, our predictions differed from actual values by 7.42% (MAPE) over the same period. CONCLUSION: Open source and automated machine learning tools like Prophet can be applied and are effective in the context of COVID-19 for forecasting spread in naive communities. It may help countries to efficiently allocate healthcare resources to contain this pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In this study, we aimed to model the epidemic trends and estimate the essential epidemic features of COVID-19 in Italy, Spain, Germany, and France at the initial stage. The numbers of daily confirmed cases and total confirmed cases were extracted from the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation reports of WHO. We applied an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model to fit the epidemic trend and estimated corresponding epidemic features. The transmission rate estimates were 1.67 (95% credible interval (CrI), 1.64-1.71), 2.83 (2.72-2.85), 1.91 (1.84-1.98), and 1.89 (1.82-1.96) for Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, corresponding to the basic reproduction numbers (R0) 3.44 (3.35-3.54), 6.25 (5.97-6.55), 4.03 (3.84-4.23), and 4.00 (3.82-4.19), respectively. We found Spain had the lowest ascertainment rate of 0.22 (0.19-0.25), followed by France, Germany, and Italy of 0.45 (0.40-0.50), 0.46 (0.40-0.52), and 0.59 (0.55-0.64). The peaks of daily new confirmed cases would reach on April 16, April 5, April 21, and April 19 for Italy, Spain, Germany, and France if no action was taken by the authorities. Given the high transmissibility and high covertness of COVID-19, strict countermeasures, such as national lockdown and social distancing, were essential to be implemented to reduce the spread of the disease.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33163739,"Estimating effective reproduction number using generation time versus serial interval, with application to covid-19 in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada.",covid-19;generation time;incubation period;reproduction number;serial interval,"BACKGROUND: The effective reproduction number R e (t) is a critical measure of epidemic potential. R e (t) can be calculated in near real time using an incidence time series and the generation time distribution: the time between infection events in an infector-infectee pair. In calculating R e (t), the generation time distribution is often approximated by the serial interval distribution: the time between symptom onset in an infector-infectee pair. However, while generation time must be positive by definition, serial interval can be negative if transmission can occur before symptoms, such as in covid-19, rendering such an approximation improper in some contexts. METHODS: We developed a method to infer the generation time distribution from parametric definitions of the serial interval and incubation period distributions. We then compared estimates of R e (t) for covid-19 in the Greater Toronto Area of Canada using: negative-permitting versus non-negative serial interval distributions, versus the inferred generation time distribution. RESULTS: We estimated the generation time of covid-19 to be Gamma-distributed with mean 3.99 and standard deviation 2.96 days. Relative to the generation time distribution, non-negative serial interval distribution caused overestimation of R e (t) due to larger mean, while negative-permitting serial interval distribution caused underestimation of R e (t) due to larger variance. IMPLICATIONS: Approximation of the generation time distribution of covid-19 with non-negative or negative-permitting serial interval distributions when calculating R e (t) may result in over or underestimation of transmission potential, respectively.",Epidemic Forecasting;Transmission

Our context is an effort to inform policy regarding social behavior, to mitigate strain on hospital capacity. The model unknowns are taken to be: the time-varying transmission rate, the fraction of exposed cases that require hospitalization, and the time-varying detection probabilities of new asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. In simulations, we obtain estimates of undetected (that is, unmeasured) infectious populations, by measuring the detected cases together with the recovered and dead - and without assumed knowledge of the detection rates. Given a noiseless measurement of the recovered population, excellent estimates of all quantities are obtained using a temporal baseline of 101 days, with the exception of the time-varying transmission rate at times prior to the implementation of social distancing. With low noise added to the recovered population, accurate state estimates require a lengthening of the temporal baseline of measurements. Estimates of all parameters are sensitive to the contamination, highlighting the need for accurate and uniform methods of reporting. The aim of this paper is to exemplify the power of SDA to determine what properties of measurements will yield estimates of unknown parameters to a desired precision, in a model with the complexity required to capture important features of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

The model is theoretically analyzed in continuous-time compartmental version and discrete-time version on random regular graphs and complex networks.

In an attempt to respond to this emergency, researchers worldwide are intensively studying the dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic. In this study, a Susceptible - Infected - Removed - Sick (SIRSi) compartmental model is proposed, which is a modification of the classical Susceptible - Infected - Removed (SIR) model. The proposed model considers the possibility of unreported or asymptomatic cases, and differences in the immunity within a population, i.e., the possibility that the acquired immunity may be temporary, which occurs when adopting one of the parameters ( gamma ) other than zero. Local asymptotic stability and endemic equilibrium conditions are proved for the proposed model. The model is adjusted to the data from three major cities of the state of Sao Paulo in Brazil, namely, Sao Paulo, Santos, and Campinas, providing estimations of duration and peaks related to the disease propagation. This study reveals that temporary immunity favors a second wave of infection and it depends on the time interval for a recovered person to be susceptible again. It also indicates the possibility that a greater number of patients would get infected with decreased time for reinfection.",Epidemic Forecasting

Predicting the epidemiological behavior of this outbreak has a vital role to prevent its spreading. In this study, long short-term memory (LSTM) network as a robust deep learning model is proposed to forecast the number of total confirmed cases, total recovered cases, and total deaths in Saudi Arabia. The model was trained using the official reported data. The optimal values of the model's parameters that maximize the forecasting accuracy were determined. The forecasting accuracy of the model was assessed using seven statistical assessment criteria, namely, root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R(2)), mean absolute error (MAE), ef fi ciency coef fi cient (EC), overall index (OI), coefficient of variation (COV), and coef fi cient of residual mass (CRM). A reasonable forecasting accuracy was obtained. The forecasting accuracy of the suggested model is compared with two other models. The first is a statistical based model called autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The second is an artificial intelligence based model called nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural networks (NARANN). Finally, the proposed LSTM model was applied to forecast the total number of confirmed cases as well as deaths in six different countries; Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, and USA. These countries have different epidemic trends as they apply different polices and have different age structure, weather, and culture. The social distancing and protection measures applied in different countries are assumed to be maintained during the forecasting period.

Based on data collected from the Ministry of Health from February 26, 2020, to July 2, 2020, we predict, from July 3 to 9 and at the end of the epidemic, the number of infected and killed for the whole country and for the Brazilian states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

Future generations will look back on this difficult period and see how our society as a whole united and rose to this challenge. Many reports have suggested that this new virus is becoming comparable to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. We provide a statistical study on the modelling and analysis of the daily incidence of COVID-19 in eighteen countries around the world. In particular, we investigate whether it is possible to fit count regression models to the number of daily new cases of COVID-19 in various countries and make short term predictions of these numbers. The results suggest that the biggest advantage of these methods is that they are simplistic and straightforward allowing us to obtain preliminary results and an overall picture of the trends in the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the world. The best fitting count regression model for modelling the number of new daily COVID-19 cases of all countries analysed was shown to be a negative binomial distribution with log link function. Whilst the results cannot solely be used to determine and influence policy decisions, they provide an alternative to more specialised epidemiological models and can help to support or contradict results obtained from other analysis.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In this article, we propose a simple and easy-to-use Bayesian model to estimate the infection rate, which is only partially identified. The model is based on the mapping from the fraction of positive test results to the cumulative infection rate, which depends on two unknown quantities: the probability of a false negative test result and a measure of testing bias towards the infected population. Accumulating evidence about SARS-CoV-2 can be incorporated into the model, which will lead to more precise inference about the infection rate.",Epidemic Forecasting

Nevertheless, all of the reports are limited compared to data from the same period over the past few years, providing mainly an overview of past events, with no future predictions. Lockdown level can be directly related to the number of new COVID-19 cases, air pollution, and economic restriction. As lockdown status varies considerably across the globe, there is a window for mega-cities to determine the optimum lockdown flexibility. To that end, firstly, we employed four different Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to examine the compatibility to the original levels of CO, O3, NO2, NO, PM2.5, and PM10, for Sao Paulo City, the current Pandemic epicenter in South America. After checking compatibility, we simulated four hypothetical scenarios: 10%, 30%, 70%, and 90% lockdown to predict air pollution levels. To our knowledge, ANN have not been applied to air pollution prediction by lockdown level. Using a limited database, the Multilayer Perceptron neural network has proven to be robust (with Mean Absolute Percentage Error approximately 30%), with acceptable predictive power to estimate air pollution changes. We illustrate that air pollutant levels can effectively be controlled and predicted when flexible lockdown measures are implemented. The models will be a useful tool for governments to manage the delicate balance among lockdown, number of COVID-19 cases, and air pollution.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33156071,A Risk Model of Admitting Patients With Silent SARS-CoV-2 Infection to Surgery and Development of Severe Postoperative Outcomes and Death: Projections Over 24 Months for 5 Geographical Regions.,,"OBJECTIVE: To model the risk of admitting silent COVID-19-infected patients to surgery with subsequent risk of severe pulmonary complications and mortality. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: With millions of operations cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic, pressure is mounting to reopen and increase surgical activity. The risk of admitting patients who have silent SARS-Cov-2 infection to surgery is not well investigated, but surgery on patients with COVID-19 is associated with poor outcomes. We aimed to model the risk of operating on nonsymptomatic infected individuals and associated risk of perioperative adverse outcomes and death. METHODS: We developed 2 sets of models to evaluate the risk of admitting silent COVID-19-infected patients to surgery. A static model let the underlying infection rate (R rate) and the gross population-rate of surgery vary. In a stochastic model, the dynamics of the COVID-19 prevalence and a fixed population-rate of surgery was considered. We generated uncertainty intervals (UIs) for our estimates by running low and high scenarios using the lower and upper 90% uncertainty limits. The modelling was applied for high-income regions (eg, United Kingdom (UK), USA (US) and European Union without UK (EU27), and for the World (WORLD) based on the WHO standard population. RESULTS: Both models provided concerning rates of perioperative risk over a 24-months period. For the US, the modelled rates were 92,000 (UI 68,000-124,000) pulmonary complications and almost 30,000 deaths (UI 22,000-40.000), respectively; for Europe, some 131,000 patients (UI 97,000-178,000) with pulmonary complications and close to 47,000 deaths (UI 34,000-63,000) were modelled. For the UK, the model suggested a median daily number of operations on silently infected ranging between 25 and 90, accumulating about 18,700 (UI 13,700-25,300) perioperative pulmonary complications and 6400 (UI 4600-8600) deaths. In high-income regions combined, we estimated around 259,000 (UI 191,000-351,000) pulmonary complications and 89,000 deaths (UI 65,000-120,000). For the WORLD, even low surgery rates estimated a global number of 1.2 million pulmonary complications and 350,000 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The model highlights a considerable risk of admitting patients with silent COVID-19 to surgery with an associated risk for adverse perioperative outcomes and deaths. Strategies to avoid excessive complications and deaths after surgery during the pandemic are needed.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

These mobility reports help to quantify the effect of the population movement restrictions on the evolution of the active infection cases. We also approximate the number of the population infected unreported, the proportion of those that need hospitalization, and estimate the end of the epidemic wave. Moreover, we use our model to estimate the second wave of the COVID-19 Algeria and Morocco and to project the end of the second wave. Finally, we suggest some additional measures that can be considered to reduce the burden of the COVID-19 and would lead to a second wave of the spread of the virus in these countries.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We found, based on the adjusted data, the highest value in infected people according to official and theoretical data. Furthermore, using a geographical analysis based on geostatistical measures related to density of demographic and economic data, traffic level and geolocation, raster files were generated to estimate probability of coronavirus cases occurrence using the areas where the contagion may occur. We also distributed the maximum contagion obtained by the epidemic model, using these raster files, and a regression model to weight factors according their importance.

These included clinical management of active cases, rapid development of treatment strategies, vaccines computational modelling and statistical tools to name a few. This article presents a mathematical model for a time series prediction and analyzes the impact of the lockdown. Methods: Several existing mathematical models were not able to account for asymptomatic patients, with limited testing capability at onset and no data on serosurveillance. In this study, a new model was used which was developed on lines of susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered (SAIR) to assess the impact of the lockdown and make predictions on its future course. Four parameters were used, namely beta, gamma, eta and epsilon. beta measures the likelihood of the susceptible person getting infected, and gamma denotes recovery rate of patients. The ratio beta/gamma is denoted by R0 (basic reproduction number). Results: The disease spread was reduced due to initial lockdown. An increase in gamma reflects healthcare and hospital services, medications and protocols put in place. In Delhi, the predictions from the model were corroborated with July and September serosurveys, which showed antibodies in 23.5 and 33 per cent population, respectively. Interpretation & conclusions: The SAIR model has helped understand the disease better. If the model is correct, we may have reached herd immunity with about 380 million people already infected. However, personal protective measures remain crucial. If there was no lockdown, the number of active infections would have peaked at close to 14.7 million, resulted in more than 2.6 million deaths, and the peak would have arrived by June 2020. The number of deaths with the current trends may be less than 0.2 million.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33146109,A Computational Modeling Study of COVID-19 in Bangladesh.,,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally. Only three cases in Bangladesh were reported on March 8, 2020. Here, we aim to predict the epidemic progression for 1 year under different scenarios in Bangladesh. We extracted the number of daily confirmed cases from March 8 to July 20, 2020. We considered the suspected-infected-removed (SIR) model and performed a maximum likelihood-based grid search to determine the removal rate (). The transmission was modeled as a stochastic random walk process, and sequential Monte Carlo simulation was run 100 times with bootstrap fits to infer the transmission rate (beta) and R t. According to the simulation, the (real) peak daily incidence of 3,600 would be followed by a steady decline, reaching below 1,000 in late January 2021. Thus, the model predicted that there would still be more than 300 cases/day even after a year. However, with proper interventions, a much steeper decline would be achieved following the peak. If we apply a combined (0.8beta, 1.2) intervention, there would be less than 100 cases by mid-October, only around five odd cases at the beginning of the year 2021, and zero cases in early March 2021. The predicted total number of deaths (in status quo) after 1 year would be 8,533 which would reduce to 3,577 if combined (0.8beta, 1.2) intervention is applied. We have also predicted the ideal number of tests that Bangladesh should perform and based on that redid the whole simulation. The outcome, though worse, would be manageable with interventions according to the simulation.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Novel coronavirus called COVID-19 is a newly emerged virus that appeared in many countries of the world, but the actual source of the virus is not yet known. The outbreak has caused pandemic with 26,622,706 confirmed infections and 874,708 reported deaths worldwide till August 31, 2020, with 17,717,911 recovered cases. Currently, there exist no vaccines officially approved for the prevention or management of the disease, but alternative drugs meant for HIV, HBV, malaria and some other flus are used to treat this virus. In the present paper, a fractional-order epidemic model with two different operators called the classical Caputo operator and the Atangana-Baleanu-Caputo operator for the transmission of COVID-19 epidemic is proposed and analyzed. The reproduction number R 0 is obtained for the prediction and persistence of the disease. The dynamic behavior of the equilibria is studied by using fractional Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion and fractional La Salle invariant principle. Special attention is given to the global dynamics of the equilibria. Moreover, the fitting of parameters through least squares curve fitting technique is performed, and the average absolute relative error between COVID-19 actual cases and the model's solution for the infectious class is tried to be reduced and the best fitted values of the relevant parameters are achieved. The numerical solution of the proposed COVID-19 fractional-order model under the Caputo operator is obtained by using generalized Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method, whereas for the Atangana-Baleanu-Caputo operator, we have used a new numerical scheme. Also, the treatment compartment is included in the population which determines the impact of alternative drugs applied for treating the infected individuals.

33143594,Beyond R0: heterogeneity in secondary infections and probabilistic epidemic forecasting.,branching processes;complex networks;epidemiology,"The basic reproductive number, R0, is one of the most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health. Often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that different epidemics can exhibit, even when they have the same R0. Here, we reformulate and extend a classic result from random network theory to forecast the size of an epidemic using estimates of the distribution of secondary infections, leveraging both its average R0 and the underlying heterogeneity. Importantly, epidemics with lower R0 can be larger if they spread more homogeneously (and are therefore more robust to stochastic fluctuations). We illustrate the potential of this approach using different real epidemics with known estimates for R0, heterogeneity and epidemic size in the absence of significant intervention. Further, we discuss the different ways in which this framework can be implemented in the data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19 the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R0.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Instead of that, in this work, we introduce dynamical parameters whose time-dependence may be phenomenologically obtained by adequately extrapolating a chosen subset of the daily provided data. This phenomenological approach works extremely well to properly adjust the number of infected (and removed) individuals in time for the countries we consider. Besides, it can handle the sub-epidemic events that some countries may experience. In this way, we obtain the evolution of the pandemic without using any a priori model based on differential equations.",Epidemic Forecasting

To this end, we developed a modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) model for the contagion, and we used official data of the pandemic for identifying the parameters of this model. Our approach features two main non-standard aspects. The first one is that model parameters can be time-varying, allowing us to capture possible changes of the epidemic behavior, due for example to containment measures enforced by authorities or modifications of the epidemic characteristics and to the effect of advanced antiviral treatments. The time-varying parameters are written as linear combinations of basis functions and are then inferred from data using sparse identification techniques. The second non-standard aspect resides in the fact that we consider as model parameters also the initial number of susceptible individuals, as well as the proportionality factor relating the detected number of positives with the actual (and unknown) number of infected individuals. Identifying the model parameters amounts to a non-convex identification problem that we solve by means of a nested approach, consisting in a one-dimensional grid search in the outer loop, with a Lasso optimization problem in the inner step.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

However, the public's concern by now is to find answers for two questions; (1) When this COVID-19 pandemic will be over? and (2) After coming to its end, will COVID-19 return again in what is known as a second rebound of the pandemic? In this work, we developed a predictive model that can estimate the expected period that the virus can be stopped and the risk of the second rebound of COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we have considered the SARIMA model to predict the spread of the virus on several selected countries and used it for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic life cycle and its end. The study can be applied to predict the same for other countries as the nature of the virus is the same everywhere. The proposed model investigates the statistical estimation of the slowdown period of the pandemic which is extracted based on the concept of normal distribution. The advantages of this study are that it can help governments to act and make sound decisions and plan for future so that the anxiety of the people can be minimized and prepare the mentality of people for the next phases of the pandemic. Based on the experimental results and simulation, the most striking finding is that the proposed algorithm shows the expected COVID-19 infections for the top countries of the highest number of confirmed cases will be manifested between Dec-2020 and Apr-2021. Moreover, our study forecasts that there may be a second rebound of the pandemic in a year time if the currently taken precautions are eased completely. We have to consider the uncertain nature of the current COVID-19 pandemic and the growing inter-connected and complex world, that are ultimately demanding flexibility, robustness and resilience to cope with the unexpected future events and scenarios.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33125393,"Tracing day-zero and forecasting the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy: A compartmental modelling and numerical optimization approach.",,"INTRODUCTION: Italy became the second epicenter of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic after China, surpassing by far China's death toll. The disease swept through Lombardy, which remained in lockdown for about two months, starting from the 8th of March. As of that day, the isolation measures taken in Lombardy were extended to the entire country. Here, assuming that effectively there was one case ""zero"" that introduced the virus to the region, we provide estimates for: (a) the day-zero of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy; (b) the actual number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population until March 8; (c) the basic (R0)and the effective reproduction number (Re) based on the estimation of the actual number of infected cases. To demonstrate the efficiency of the model and approach, we also provide a tentative forecast two months ahead of time, i.e. until May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced, on the basis of the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports released by Google on March 29. METHODS: To deal with the uncertainty in the number of the actual asymptomatic infected cases in the total population Volpert et al. (2020), we address a modified compartmental Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infectious Asymptomatic/ Infected Symptomatic/ Recovered/ Dead (SEIIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the cases in the population that are asymptomatic or experience very mild symptoms and another modelling the infected cases with mild to severe symptoms. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, the time from the onset of symptoms to death and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the day-zero of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the ""effective"" per-day transmission rate for which no clinical data are available, we have used the proposed SEIIRD simulator to fit the numbers of new daily cases from February 21 to the 8th of March. This was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem. Based on the computed parameters, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number R0 and the evolution of the effective reproduction number Re. To examine the efficiency of the model and approach, we ran the simulator to ""forecast"" the epidemic two months ahead of time, i.e. from March 8 to May 4. For this purpose, we considered the reduction in mobility in Lombardy as released on March 29 by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, and the effects of social distancing and of the very strict measures taken by the government on March 20 and March 21, 2020. RESULTS: Based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the expected day-zero was January 14 (min-max rage: January 5 to January 23, interquartile range: January 11 to January 18). The actual cumulative number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population in Lombardy on March 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases, while the expected value of the basic reproduction number R0 was found to be 4.53 (min-max range: 4.40- 4.65). On May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced the effective reproduction number was found to be 0.987 (interquartiles: 0.857, 1.133). The model approximated adequately two months ahead of time the evolution of reported cases of infected until May 4, the day on which the phase I of the relaxation of measures was implemented over all of Italy. Furthermore the model predicted that until May 4, around 20% of the population in Lombardy has recovered (interquartile range: approximately 10% to approximately 30%).",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

Here we propose a simple statistical model that could be used to predict the epidemiological extent of community spread of COVID-19 from the explicit data based on optimal ARIMA model estimators. Raw data was retrieved on confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was fitted based on cumulative daily figures of confirmed cases aggregated globally for ten major countries to predict their incidence trend. Statistical analysis was completed by using R 3.5.3 software. The optimal ARIMA model having the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) value for US (0,2,0); Spain (1,2,0); France (0,2,1); Germany (3,2,2); Iran (1,2,1); China (0,2,1); Russia (3,2,1); India (2,2,2); Australia (1,2,0) and South Africa (0,2,2) imparted the nowcasting of trends for the upcoming weeks. These parameters are (p, d, q) where p refers to the number of autoregressive terms, d refers to the number of times the series has to be differenced before it becomes stationary, and q refers to the number of moving average terms. Results obtained from the ARIMA model showed a significant decrease in cases in Australia; a stable case for China and rising cases have been observed in other countries. This study predicted the possible proliferate of COVID-19, although spreading significantly depends upon the various control and measurement policy taken by each country.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Our original paper prepared in March 2020 analyzed the outbreaks of COVID-19 in the US and its selected states to identify the rise, peak, and decrease of cases within a given geographic population, as well as a rough calculation of accumulated total cases in this population from the beginning to the end of June 2020. The current report will describe how well the later actual trend from March to June fit our model and prediction. Similar analyses are also conducted to include countries other than the US. From such a wide global data analysis, our results demonstrated that different US states and countries showed dramatically different patterns of pandemic trend.

Although the situation is stable to some extent within the developed countries, approximately one million have already died as a consequence of the unique symptomatology that these people displayed. Thus, the need to develop an effective strategy for monitoring, restricting, but especially for predicting the evolution of COVID-19 is urgent, especially in middle-class countries such as Romania. Material and Methods: Therefore, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models have been created, aiming to predict the epidemiological course of COVID-19 in Romania by using two statistical software (STATGRAPHICS Centurion (v.18.1.13) and IBM SPSS (v.20.0.0)). To increase the accuracy, we collected data between the established interval (1 March, 31 August) from the official website of the Romanian Government and the World Health Organization. Results: Several ARIMA models were generated from which ARIMA (1,2,1), ARIMA (3,2,2), ARIMA (3,1,3), ARIMA (3,2,2), ARIMA (3,1,3), ARIMA (2,2,2) and ARIMA (1,2,1) were considered the best models. For this, we took into account the lowest value of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for March, April, May, June, July, and August (MAPEMarch = 9.3225, MAPEApril = 0.975287, MAPEMay = 0.227675, MAPEJune = 0.161412, MAPEJuly = 0.243285, MAPEAugust = 0.163873, MAPEMarch - August = 2.29175 for STATGRAPHICS Centurion (v.18.1.13) and MAPEMarch = 57.505, MAPEApril = 1.152, MAPEMay = 0.259, MAPEJune = 0.185, MAPEJuly = 0.307, MAPEAugust = 0.194, and MAPEMarch - August = 6.013 for IBM SPSS (v.20.0.0) respectively.

The new confirmed cases of infected individuals of COVID-19 are increasing day by day. Therefore, the prediction of infected individuals has become of utmost important for health care arrangements and to control the spread of COVID-19. In this study, we propose a compartmental epidemic model with intervention strategies such as lockdown, quarantine, and hospitalization. We compute the basic reproduction number (R0), which plays a vital role in mathematical epidemiology. Based on R0, it is revealed that the system has two equilibrium, namely disease-free and endemic. We also demonstrate the non-negativity and boundedness of the solutions, local and global stability of equilibria, transcritical bifurcation to analyze its epidemiological relevance. Furthermore, to validate our system, we fit the cumulative and new daily cases in India. We estimate the model parameters and predict the near future scenario of the disease. The global sensitivity analysis has also been performed to observe the impact of different parameters on R0. We also investigate the dynamics of disease in respect of different situations of lockdown, e.g., complete lockdown, partial lockdown, and no lockdown. Our analysis concludes that if there is partial or no lockdown case, then endemic level would be high. Along with this, the high transmission rate ensures higher level of endemicity. From the short time prediction, we predict that India may face a crucial phase (approx 6000000 infected individuals within 140 days) in near future due to COVID-19. Finally, numerical results show that COVID-19 may be controllable by reducing the contacts and increasing the efficacy of lockdown.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

We fit available daily data since the first diagnosed case until the end of June 2020 and we forecast possible scenarios of contagion associated with different levels of social distancing measures and travel inflows. We determine the initial reproductive transmission rate in Lebanon and all subsequent dynamics. In the repeated iterations (RI) model we iterate the available data of currently infected people to forecast future infections under several possible scenarios of contagion. In both models, our results suggest that tougher mitigation measures would slow down the spread of the disease. On the other hand, the current relaxation of measures and partial resumption of international flights, as the STEIR reveals, would trigger a second outbreak of infections, with severity depending on the extent of relaxation. We recommend strong institutional and public commitment to mitigation measures to avoid uncontrolled spread.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

The state of Arizona in the U.S. emerges as one of the country's newest COVID-19 hot spots. Accurate forecasting for COVID-19 cases will help governments to implement necessary measures and convince more people to take personal precautions to combat the virus. It is difficult to accurately predict the COVID- 19 cases due to many human factors involved. This paper aims to provide a forecasting model for COVID-19 cases with the help of human activity data from the Google Community Mobility Reports. To achieve this goal, a specific partial differential equation (PDE) is developed and validated with the COVID-19 data from the New York Times at the county level in the state of Arizona in the U.S. The proposed model describes the combined effects of transboundary spread among county clusters in Arizona and human activities on the transmission of COVID-19. The results show that the prediction accuracy of this model is well acceptable (above 94%). Furthermore, we study the effectiveness of personal precautions such as wearing face masks and practicing social distancing on COVID-19 cases at the local level. The localized analytical results can be used to help to slow the spread of COVID- 19 in Arizona. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to apply PDE models on COVID-19 prediction with the Google Community Mobility Reports.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33119708,A discrete-time-evolution model to forecast progress of Covid-19 outbreak.,,"Here we present a discrete-time-evolution model with one day interval to forecast the propagation of Covid-19. The proposed model can be easily implemented with daily updated data sets of the pandemic publicly available by distinct online sources. It has only two adjustable parameters and it predicts the evolution of the total number of infected people in a country for the next 14 days if parameters do not change during the analyzed period. The model incorporates the main aspects of the disease such as the fact that there are asymptomatic and symptomatic phases (both capable of propagating the virus), and that these phases take almost two weeks before the infected person status evolves to the next (asymptomatic becomes symptomatic or symptomatic becomes either recovered or dead). A striking advantage of the model for its implementation by the health sector is that it gives directly the number of total infected people in each day (in thousands, tens of thousands or hundred of thousands). Here, the model is tested with data from Brazil, UK and South Korea, presenting low error rates on the prediction of the evolution of the disease in all analyzed countries. We hope this model may be a useful tool to estimate the propagation of the disease.",Epidemic Forecasting

Many complex, highly detailed models have been developed to help policy setters make better decisions. However, the basis of these models is unlikely to be understood by non-experts. We describe the advantages of simple models for COVID-19. We say a model is ""simple"" if its only parameter is the rate of contact between people in the population. This contact rate can vary over time, depending on choices by policy setters. Such models can be understood by a broad audience, and thus can be helpful in explaining the policy decisions to the public. They can be used to evaluate the outcomes of different policies. However, simple models have a disadvantage when dealing with inhomogeneous populations. To augment the power of a simple model to evaluate complicated situations, we add what we call ""satellite"" equations that do not change the original model. For example, with the help of a satellite equation, one could know what his/her chance is of remaining uninfected through the end of an epidemic. Satellite equations can model the effects of the epidemic on high-risk individuals, death rates, and nursing homes and other isolated populations. To compare simple models with complex models, we introduce our ""slightly complex"" Model J. We find the conclusions of simple and complex models can be quite similar. However, for each added complexity, a modeler may have to choose additional parameter values describing who will infect whom under what conditions, choices for which there is often little rationale but that can have big impacts on predictions. Our simulations suggest that the added complexity offers little predictive advantage.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

We aim to develop a model from a small number of countries to predict the epidemic alert level in all the countries worldwide. Methods: The ""interest over time"" and ""interest by region"" Google Trends data of Coronavirus, pneumonia, and six COVID symptom-related terms were searched. The daily incidence of COVID-19 from 10 January to 23 April 2020 of 202 countries was retrieved from the World Health Organization. Three alert levels were defined. Ten weeks' data from 20 countries were used for training with machine learning algorithms. The features were selected according to the correlation and importance. The model was then tested on 2830 samples of 202 countries. Results: Our model performed well in 154 (76.2%) countries, of which each had no more than four misclassified samples. In these 154 countries, the accuracy was 0.8133, and the kappa coefficient was 0.6828. While in all 202 countries, the accuracy was 0.7527, and the kappa coefficient was 0.5841. The proposed algorithm based on Random Forest Classification and nine features performed better compared to other machine learning methods and the models with different numbers of features.

We aimed to evaluate epidemiological characteristics, needs of resources, outcomes, and global burden of the disease. Methods: Systematic review was performed searching PubMed from December 1, 2019, to March 25, 2020, for full-text observational studies that described epidemiological characteristics, following MOOSE protocol. Global data were collected from the JHU-Corona Virus Resource Center, WHO-COVID-2019 situation reports, KFF.org, and Worldometers.info until March 31, 2020. The prevalence percentages were calculated. The global data were plotted in excel to calculate case fatality rate (CFR), predicted CFR, COVID-19 specific mortality rate, and doubling time for cases and deaths. CFR was predicted using Pearson correlation, regression models, and coefficient of determination. Results: From 21 studies of 2747 patients, 8.4% of patients died, 20.4% recovered, 15.4% were admitted to ICU and 14.9% required ventilation. COVID-19 was more prevalent in patients with hypertension (19.3%), smoking (11.3%), diabetes mellitus (10%), and cardiovascular diseases (7.4%). Common complications were pneumonia (82%), cardiac complications (26.4%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (15.7%), secondary infection (11.2%), and septic shock (4.3%). Though CFR and COVID-19 specific death rates are dynamic, they were consistently high for Italy, Spain, and Iran. Polynomial growth models were best fit for all countries for predicting CFR. Though many interventions have been implemented, stern measures like nationwide lockdown and school closure occurred after very high infection rates (>10cases per 100 000population) prevailed. Given the trend of government measures and decline of new cases in China and South Korea, most countries will reach the peak between April 1-20, if interventions are followed. Conclusions: A collective approach undertaken by a responsible government, wise strategy implementation and a receptive population may help contain the spread of COVID-19 outbreak. Close monitoring of predictive models of such indicators in the highly affected countries would help to evaluate the potential fatality if the second wave of pandemic occurs. The future studies should be focused on identifying accurate indicators to mitigate the effect of underestimation or overestimation of COVID-19 burden.",Diagnosis;Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

The rapid pace at which the virus has spread across the world is unprecedented. The sheer number of infected cases and fatalities in such a short period of time has overwhelmed medical facilities across the globe. The rapid pace of the spread of the novel coronavirus makes it imperative that its' spread be forecasted well in advance in order to plan for eventualities. An accurate early forecasting of the number of cases would certainly assist governments and various other organizations to strategize and prepare for the newly infected cases, well in advance. In this work, a novel method of forecasting the future cases of infection, based on the study of data mined from the internet search terms of people in the affected region, is proposed. The study utilizes relevant Google Trends of specific search terms related to COVID-19 pandemic along with European Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC) data on COVID-19 spread, to forecast the future trends of daily new cases, cumulative cases and deaths for India, USA and UK. For this purpose, a hybrid GWO-LSTM model is developed, where the network parameters of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network are optimized using Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). The results of the proposed model are compared with the baseline models including Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and it is observed that the proposed model achieves much better results in forecasting the future trends of the spread of infection. Using the proposed hybrid GWO-LSTM model incorporating online big data from Google Trends, a reduction in Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values for forecasting results to the extent of about 98% have been observed. Further, reduction in MAPE by 74% for models incorporating Google Trends was observed, thus, confirming the efficacy of utilizing public sentiments in terms of search frequencies of relevant terms online, in forecasting pandemic numbers.",Epidemic Forecasting

Dynamic trends of region-specific time-variant reproduction number, social-distancing rate, work-resumption rate, and suspected-cases isolation rate have been estimated and plotted for each region by fitting stochastic transmission processes to the real total confirmed cases reported of each region. We find after shutdown in Wuhan, the reproduction number in Wuhan greatly declined from 6.982 (95% CI 2.558-14.668) on January 23rd, 2020 to 1.130 (95% CI 0.289-3.279) on February 7th, 2020, and there was a higher intervention level in terms of social-distancing and suspected-cases isolation in Wuhan than the Chinese average and Western average, for the period from the shutdown in Wuhan to mid-March. Future epidemic trajectories of Western countries up to October 10th, 2020, have been predicted with 95% confidence intervals.

Lack of specialized treatments for the disease demands preventive measures based on statistical/mathematical models. The analysis of epidemiological curve fitting, on number of daily infections across affected countries, provides useful insights on the characteristics of the epidemic. A variety of phenomenological models are available to capture the dynamics of disease spread and growth. The number of daily new infections and cumulative number of infections in COVID-19 over four selected countries, namely, Sri Lanka, Italy, the United States, and Hebei province of China, from the first day of appearance of cases to 2(nd) July 2020 were used in the study. Gompertz, logistic, Weibull, and exponential growth curves were fitted on the cumulative number of infections across countries. AIC, BIC, RMSE, and R (2) were used to determine the best fitting curve for each country. Results revealed that the most appropriate growth curves for Sri Lanka, Italy, the United States, and China (Hebei) are the logistic, Gompertz, Weibull, and Gompertz curves, respectively. Country-wise, overall growth rate, final epidemic size, and short-term forecasts were evaluated using the selected model. Daily log incidences in each country were regressed before and after the identified peak time of the respective outbreak of epidemic. Hence, doubling time/halving time together with daily growth rates and predictions was estimated.

Thus, comprehension of the epidemic curve is very important to predict its evolution and subsequently adapt the best prevention strategies. In this way, the current study was conducted to estimate the parameters of the classical SIR model and to predict the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Algeria using data from February 25th, 2020 to August 12th, 2020. Results: Results showed that the peak of the epidemic will be reached on September 8th, 2021 and the total infected persons will exceed 800,000 cases at the end of the epidemic. Also, more than 15 million persons will be susceptible. The reproduction number (R 0) is estimated at 1.23254.

The model employs basic concepts from fluid dynamics and incorporates the known scope of factors involved in the airborne transmission of such diseases. Simplicity in the mathematical form of the model is by design so that it can serve not only as a common basis for scientific inquiry across disciplinary boundaries but it can also be understandable by a broad audience outside science and academia. The caveats and limitations of the model are discussed in detail. The model is used to assess the protection from transmission afforded by face coverings made from a variety of fabrics. The reduction in the transmission risk associated with increased physical distance between the host and susceptible is also quantified by coupling the model with available and new large eddy simulation data on scalar dispersion in canonical flows. Finally, the effect of the level of physical activity (or exercise intensity) of the host and the susceptible in enhancing the transmission risk is also assessed.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission

A stochastic extension of the deterministic model is further considered to capture the uncertainty or variation observed in the disease transmissibility. In the case of a deterministic system, the disease-free equilibrium will be globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is less than unity, otherwise, the disease persists. Using Lyapunov functional methods, we prove that the infected population of the stochastic system tends to zero exponentially almost surely if the basic reproduction number is less than unity. The stochastic system has no interior equilibrium, however, its asymptotic solution is shown to fluctuate around the endemic equilibrium of the deterministic system under some parametric restrictions, implying that the infection persists. A case study with the Covid-19 epidemic data of Spain is presented and various analytical results have been demonstrated. The epidemic curve in Spain clearly shows two waves of infection. The first wave was observed during March-April and the second wave started in the middle of July and not completed yet. A real-time reproduction number has been given to illustrate the epidemiological status of Spain throughout the study period. Estimated cumulative numbers of confirmed and death cases are 1,613,626 and 42,899, respectively, with case fatality rate 2.66% till the deadly virus is eliminated from Spain.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Therefore to restrict the spreading of pandemic COVID-19, various researches are going on in both medical and administrative sectors. The focus has been given in this research keeping an administrative point of view in mind. In this paper a dynamic model of infected population due to spreading of pandemic COVID-19 considering both intra and inter zone mobilization factors with rate of detection has been proposed. Few factors related to intra zone mobilization; inter zone mobilization and rate of detection are the key points in the proposed model. Various remedial steps are taken into consideration in the form of operating procedures. Further such operating procedures are applied over the model in standalone or hybridized mode and responses are reported in this paper in a case-studies manner. Further zone-wise increase in infected population due to the spreading of pandemic COVID-19 has been studied and reported in this paper. Also the proposed model has been applied over the real world data considering three states of India and the predicted responses are compared with real data and reported with bar chart representation in this paper.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

These restrictions classify the population into the states of a flow network where people are coming and going according to pandemic evolution. A new dynamical model based on flow networks is proposed. The model fits well with the well-known SIR family model and add a new perspective of the evolution of the infected people among the states. This perspective allows to model different scenarios and illustrates the evolution and trends of the pandemic because it is based on the open data daily provided by the governments. To measure the severity of the pandemic along the time, a danger index (DI) is proposed in addition to the well-known R0 index. This index is a function of infected cases, number of deaths and recover cases while the transmission index R0 depends only on the infected cases. These two indexes are compared in relation to data from Spain and the Netherlands and additionally, it is shown the relation of the danger index with the policy applied by the governments.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

Our specification that assumes the growth rate of active infections can be represented by autoregressive fluctuations around a downward sloping deterministic trend function with a break. Our fully Bayesian approach allows us to flexibly estimate the cross-sectional distribution of slopes and then implicitly use this distribution as prior to construct Bayes forecasts for the individual time series. We find some evidence that information from locations with an early outbreak can sharpen forecast accuracy for late locations. There is generally a lot of uncertainty about the evolution of active infection, due to parameter and shock uncertainty, in particular before and around the peak of the infection path. Over a one-week horizon, the empirical coverage frequency of our interval forecasts is close to the nominal credible level.

33091766,Uncertainty quantification in epidemiological models for the COVID-19 pandemic.,bayesian inversion;covid-19 pandemic;coronavirus forecasting;epidemic models;mcmc methods,"Mathematical modeling of epidemiological diseases using differential equations are of great importance in order to recognize the characteristics of the diseases and their outbreak. The procedure of modeling consists of two essential components: the first component is to solve the mathematical model numerically, the so-called forward modeling. The second component is to identify the unknown parameter values in the model, which is known as inverse modeling and leads to identifying the epidemiological model more precisely. The main goal of this paper is to develop the forward and inverse modeling of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic using novel computational methodologies in order to accurately estimate and predict the pandemic. This leads to governmental decisions support in implementing effective protective measures and prevention of new outbreaks. To this end, we use the logistic equation and the SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) system of ordinary differential equations to model the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the inverse modeling, we propose Bayesian inversion techniques, which are robust and reliable approaches, in order to estimate the unknown parameters of the epidemiological models. We deploy an adaptive Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the estimation of a posteriori probability distribution and confidence intervals for the unknown model parameters as well as for the reproduction number. We perform our analyses on the publicly available data for Austria to estimate the main epidemiological model parameters and to study the effectiveness of the protective measures by the Austrian government. The estimated parameters and the analysis of fatalities provide useful information for decision-makers and makes it possible to perform more realistic forecasts of future outbreaks. According to our Bayesian analysis for the logistic model, the growth rate and the carrying capacity are estimated respectively as 0.28 and 14974. Moreover for the parameters of the SIR model, namely the transmission rate and recovery rate, we estimate 0.36 and 0.06, respectively. Additionally, we obtained an average infectious period of 17 days and a transmission period of 3 days for COVID-19 in Austria. We also estimate the reproduction number over time for Austria. This quantity is estimated around 3 on March 26, when the first recovery was reported. Then it decays to 1 at the beginning of April. Furthermore, we present a fatality analysis for COVID-19 in Austria, which is also of importance for governmental protective decision-making. According to our analysis, the case fatality rate (CFR) is estimated as 4% and a prediction of the number of fatalities for the coming 10 days is also presented. Additionally, the ICU bed usage in Austria indicates that around 2% of the active infected individuals are critical cases and require ICU beds. Therefore, if Austrian governmental protective measures would not have taken place and for instance if the number of active infected cases would have been around five times larger, the ICU bed capacity could have been exceeded.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention
33091374,Estimating the infection-fatality risk of SARS-CoV-2 in New York City during the spring 2020 pandemic wave: a model-based analysis.,,"BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, the infection-fatality risk (ie, risk of death among all infected individuals including those with asymptomatic and mild infections) is crucial for gauging the burden of death due to COVID-19 in the coming months or years. Here, we estimate the infection-fatality risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New York City, NY, USA, the first epidemic centre in the USA, where the infection-fatality risk remains unclear. METHODS: In this model-based analysis, we developed a meta-population network model-inference system to estimate the underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in New York City during the 2020 spring pandemic wave using available case, mortality, and mobility data. Based on these estimates, we further estimated the infection-fatality risk for all ages overall and for five age groups (<25, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, and >/=75 years) separately, during the period March 1 to June 6, 2020 (ie, before the city began a phased reopening). FINDINGS: During the period March 1 to June 6, 2020, 205 639 people had a laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and 21 447 confirmed and probable COVID-19-related deaths occurred among residents of New York City. We estimated an overall infection-fatality risk of 1.39% (95% credible interval 1.04-1.77) in New York City. Our estimated infection-fatality risk for the two oldest age groups (65-74 and >/=75 years) was much higher than the younger age groups, with a cumulative estimated infection-fatality risk of 0.116% (0.0729-0.148) for those aged 25-44 years and 0.939% (0.729-1.19) for those aged 45-64 years versus 4.87% (3.37-6.89) for those aged 65-74 years and 14.2% (10.2-18.1) for those aged 75 years and older. In particular, weekly infection-fatality risk was estimated to be as high as 6.72% (5.52-8.01) for those aged 65-74 years and 19.1% (14.7-21.9) for those aged 75 years and older. INTERPRETATION: Our results are based on more complete ascertainment of COVID-19-related deaths in New York City than other places and thus probably reflect the true higher burden of death due to COVID-19 than that previously reported elsewhere. Given the high infection-fatality risk of SARS-CoV-2, governments must account for and closely monitor the infection rate and population health outcomes and enact prompt public health responses accordingly as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds.

METHODS: Total number of reported cases were plotted against total number of tests for COVID-19 performed over time, with and without smoothing, for Canada and some Canadian provinces individually. Changes in curvature profile were identified as either convex or concave as indicators of pandemic acceleration or deceleration, respectively. Rt estimates were calculated on an exponential growth rate. RESULTS: For Canada as a whole, the testing graphs had a slightly concave profile and a coincident decrease in Rt estimates. Saskatchewan more recently had a convex profile with a gradual shift to a concave profile and also demonstrated a gradual decline in Rt estimates. Curves and Rt estimates for Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec displayed a gradual shift towards concavity over time and an overall decrease in Rt estimates, which is suggestive of a positive impact of public health interventions implemented federally and provincially. CONCLUSION: The present analyses compared a mathematical tool to Rt estimates to ascertain the status of the pandemic in Canada. Caution should be taken when interpreting results due to factors such as varying testing protocols, available testing data unique to each province and limitations inherent to each method, which may generate different results using the two approaches. Analysis of testing data may complement metrics obtained from surveillance data to allow for a weight-of-evidence approach to assess the status of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In comparison with emergencies re-allocation of resources for a long period of time is required and the peak utilization of the resources is also hard to predict. Furthermore, the epidemic models do not provide reliable information of the development of the pandemic's development, so it creates a high load on the healthcare systems with unforeseen duration. To predict morbidity of the novel COVID-19, we used records covering the time period from 01-03-2020 to 25-05-2020 and include sophisticated information of the morbidity in Russia. Total of 45238 patients were analyzed. The predictive model was developed as a combination of Holt and Holt-Winter models with Gradient boosting Regression. As we can see from the table 2, the models demonstrated a very good performance on the test data set. The forecast is quite reliable, however, due to the many uncertainties, only a real-world data can prove the correctness of the forecast.",Epidemic Forecasting

Understanding the level of ascertainment (the ratio of confirmed symptomatic cases to the true number of symptomatic individuals) and undetected epidemic progression is crucial to informing COVID-19 response planning, including the introduction and relaxation of control measures. Estimating case ascertainment over time allows for accurate estimates of specific outcomes such as seroprevalence, which is essential for planning control measures. METHODS: Using reported data on COVID-19 cases and fatalities globally, we estimated the proportion of symptomatic cases (i.e. any person with any of fever >/= 37.5 degrees C, cough, shortness of breath, sudden onset of anosmia, ageusia or dysgeusia illness) that were reported in 210 countries and territories, given those countries had experienced more than ten deaths. We used published estimates of the baseline case fatality ratio (CFR), which was adjusted for delays and under-ascertainment, then calculated the ratio of this baseline CFR to an estimated local delay-adjusted CFR to estimate the level of under-ascertainment in a particular location. We then fit a Bayesian Gaussian process model to estimate the temporal pattern of under-ascertainment. RESULTS: Based on reported cases and deaths, we estimated that, during March 2020, the median percentage of symptomatic cases detected across the 84 countries which experienced more than ten deaths ranged from 2.4% (Bangladesh) to 100% (Chile). Across the ten countries with the highest number of total confirmed cases as of 6 July 2020, we estimated that the peak number of symptomatic cases ranged from 1.4 times (Chile) to 18 times (France) larger than reported. Comparing our model with national and regional seroprevalence data where available, we find that our estimates are consistent with observed values. Finally, we estimated seroprevalence for each country. As of 7 June, our seroprevalence estimates range from 0% (many countries) to 13% (95% CrI 5.6-24%) (Belgium). CONCLUSIONS: We found substantial under-ascertainment of symptomatic cases, particularly at the peak of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in many countries. Reported case counts will therefore likely underestimate the rate of outbreak growth initially and underestimate the decline in the later stages of an epidemic. Although there was considerable under-reporting in many locations, our estimates were consistent with emerging serological data, suggesting that the proportion of each country's population infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide is generally low.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

33082843,Identification of an Epidemiological Model to Simulate the COVID-19 Epidemic Using Robust Multiobjective Optimization and Stochastic Fractal Search.,,"Traditionally, the identification of parameters in the formulation and solution of inverse problems considers that models, variables, and mathematical parameters are free of uncertainties. This aspect simplifies the estimation process, but does not consider the influence of relatively small changes in the design variables in terms of the objective function. In this work, the SIDR (Susceptible, Infected, Dead, and Recovered) model is used to simulate the dynamic behavior of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and its parameters are estimated by formulating a robust inverse problem, that is, considering the sensitivity of design variables. For this purpose, a robust multiobjective optimization problem is formulated, considering the minimization of uncertainties associated with the estimation process and the maximization of the robustness parameter. To solve this problem, the Multiobjective Stochastic Fractal Search algorithm is associated with the Effective Mean concept for the evaluation of robustness. The results obtained considering real data of the epidemic in China demonstrate that the evaluation of the sensitivity of the design variables can provide more reliable results.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention

In most countries in the world, the outbreak of the disease has been serious and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has increased daily, while, fortunately the recovered COVID-19 cases have also increased. Clearly, forecasting the ""confirmed"" and ""recovered"" COVID-19 cases helps planning to control the disease and plan for utilization of health care resources. Time series models based on statistical methodology are useful to model time-indexed data and for forecasting. Autoregressive time series models based on two-piece scale mixture normal distributions, called TP-SMN-AR models, is a flexible family of models involving many classical symmetric/asymmetric and light/heavy tailed autoregressive models. In this paper, we use this family of models to analyze the real world time series data of confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases.",Epidemic Forecasting

We investigate the dependence of the basic reproduction number on the commuter ratio and the daily expected duration at the social phase as essential factors characterizing the community structure, and show that the dependence is significantly affected by the combination of contact patterns, and that the difference in the commuter ratio could make the risk of the spread of a transmissible disease significantly different.",Epidemic Forecasting;Prevention;Transmission
