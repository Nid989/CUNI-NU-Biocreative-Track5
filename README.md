Team CUNI-NU at BioCreative VII LitCovid Track: Multi-label Topical Classification of Scientific Articles using SPECTER Embeddings with Dual Attention and Label-Wise Attention Network

# Introduction
The rapid growth of biomedical literature makes manual curation and interpretation extremely difficult. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this challenge has become more apparent: the number of COVID-19-related articles in the literature is increasing at a rate of about 10,000 per month. LitCovid, a PubMed-based literature database of COVID-19-related papers, now has over 100,000 articles and receives millions of monthly accesses from users around the world.

# Data
The training and development datasets contain the publicly-available text of over 30 thousand COVID-19-related articles and their metadata (e.g., title, abstract, journal). Articles in both datasets have been manually reviewed and articles annotated by in-house models
